Will Rodman (James Franco) is a scientist, currently residing in San Francisco, who is working on a cure for Alzheimer's Disease by performing tests on apes. The first test subject is a chimpanzee, named Caesar (Andy Serkis), whose parents had been captured in Africa. Rodman's ""cure"" not only repairs brain cells as they expected to, but it genetically modifies Caesar's way of thinking to create a new breed of ape with human-like intelligence. Caesar learns unbelievably well, but human authority orders him to be locked up. However, he eventually proves to be smart enough to escape from his cage and releases an airborne-strain of the cure that advances the intelligence of his fellow apes. Caesar soon builds an army of enhanced apes in order to overthrow humanity and assert apes as Earth's dominant species.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes (originally titled Caesar and Rise of the Apes) is an upcoming 2011 American science fiction film. The film is directed by Rupert Wyatt. It is a reboot of the Planet of the Apes series that will act as a foundation with an origin story for a new film series. Its premise is similar to the fourth film in the original series Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972), but it is not a direct remake in that it does not fit into that series' continuity. It is slated for release in the United States and Canada on August 5, 2011.

Aibileen (Viola Davis), Skeeter's best friend's housekeeper, is the first to open up -- to the dismay of her friends in the tight-knit black community. Despite Skeeter's life-long friendships hanging in the balance, she and Aibileen continue their collaboration and soon more women come forward to tell their stories -- and as it turns out, they have a lot to say. Along the way, unlikely friendships are forged and a new sisterhood emerges, but not before everyone in town has a thing or two to say themselves when they become unwittingly -- and unwillingly -- caught up in the changing times.

ABOUT
When Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) returns to Minneapolis from business in Hong Kong, what she thought was jet lag takes a virulent turn. Two days later, she’s dead in the ER and the doctors tell her shocked and grieving husband (Matt Damon) they have no idea why.

Soon more cases are reported as the virus begins to spread. Doctors at the United States Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization mobilize to break the code of this unique biological pathogen as it continues to mutate.

Deputy Director Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) tries to allay the growing panic despite his own personal concerns, and must send a brave young doctor (Kate Winslet) into harm’s way.

As the death toll escalates and people struggle to protect themselves and their loved ones in a society breaking down, one activist blogger (Jude Law) claims the public isn’t getting the truth about what’s really going on, and sets off an epidemic of paranoia and fear as infectious as the virus itself.

Starring Academy Award® winners Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Gwyneth Paltrow and Marion Cotillard, and Academy Award® and Golden Globe® nominees Jude Law, Laurence Fishburne and John Hawkes. 

Directed and produced by Academy Award-winner Steven Soderbergh.

Haunted by a tragic past, ex-Marine Tommy Conlon (Hardy) returns home for the first time in fourteen years to enlist the help of his father (Nick Nolte) to train for SPARTA, the biggest winner-takes-all event in mixed martial arts history. A former wrestling prodigy, Tommy blazes a path toward the championship while his brother, Brendan (Edgerton), an ex-fighter-turned teacher, returns to the ring in a desperate bid to save his family from financial ruin. But when Brendan's unlikely, underdog rise sets him on a collision course with the unstoppable Tommy, the two brothers must finally confront each other and the forces that pulled them apart, facing off in the most soaring, soul stirring, and unforgettable climax that must be seen to be believed. A rousing ode to redemption, reconciliation and the power of the human spirit, WARRIOR is also a moving testament to the enduring bonds of family.",2011-09-07T17:45:56Z,"['Joel Edgerton', 'Tom Hardy', 'Jennifer Morrison', 'Nick Nolte', 'movie', 'clips', 'movieclips', 'movieclips.com', 'movieclipsDOTcom', '2011', 'Warrior', 'Warrior movie trailer', 'Warrior movie trailer HD', 'Warrior trailer HD', 'Warrior trailer']",6511789,21073,631,1269,59440,0.2888386123680241

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Tommy (Tom Hardy) volunteers to spar with Mad Dog (Erik Apple) at the gym.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Two estranged brothers and Mixed Martial Arts fighters confront the forces that tore their family apart as they prepare to do battle in the ring in this drama from director Gavin O'Connor (Pride and Glory). Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is an ex-Marine from Pittsburgh who's never quite shaken his troubled past. Upon learning that the purse in an upcoming MMA tournament is the largest in the league's history, Tommy recruits his father, Paddy (Nick Nolte), a former coach and recovering alcoholic, to whip him into shape in time for the competition. Meanwhile, as Tommy steadily ascends the ranks by defeating one powerful opponent after another, his brother, Brendan, struggles to provide for his family with his job as a public school teacher. A former MMA fighter with a devastating punch, Brendan begins to wonder if he, too, could have a shot at winning the coveted purse. In time, Brendan and Tommy both emerge as dark horse contenders in the competition, setting the two brothers on a brutal collision course. But Tommy and Brendan's biggest battle won't be fought in the ring -- it will be fought in their hearts and minds.

HvcQ39OBzzo,Marina Abramović The Artist is Present - Official Trailer,Dogwoof,UCNruPWfg4GUGw3RcwaKtsXQ,"http://marinafilm.co.uk/

Seductive, fearless, and outrageous, Marina Abramović has been redefining what art is for nearly 40 years. Using her own body as a vehicle, pushing herself beyond her limits -- and at times risking her life in the process -- she creates performances that challenge, shock, and move us. MARINA ABRAMOVIĆ THE ARTIST IS PRESENT follows the artist as she prepares for what may be the most important moment of her life: a major new retrospective of her work, taking place at The Museum of Modern Art. To be given a retrospective at one of the world's premier museums is the most exhilarating sort of milestone. For Marina, it is far more: it is the chance to finally silence the 
question she has been hearing over and over again for four decades: ""But why is this art?""

Directed by Matthew Akers and Jeffrey Dupre

A gritty, white-knuckle, action ride set in the near-future where the sport of boxing has gone high-tech, Real Steel stars Hugh Jackman as Charlie Kenton, a washed-up fighter who lost his chance at a title when 2000-pound, 8-foot-tall steel robots took over the ring. Now nothing but a small-time promoter, Charlie earns just enough money piecing together low-end bots from scrap metal to get from one underground boxing venue to the next. When Charlie hits rock bottom, he reluctantly teams up with his estranged son Max (Dakota Goyo) to build and train a championship contender. As the stakes in the brutal, no-holds-barred arena are raised, Charlie and Max, against all odds, get one last shot at a comeback.

Der Action-Thriller IN TIME - DEINE ZEIT LÄUFT AB versetzt den Zuschauer in eine Welt, in der die offizielle Währung Geld durch Zeit ersetzt wird. Mit 25 hören die Menschen auf zu altern. Sie sind genetisch so ausgestattet, dass sie nur noch ein Jahr lang überleben können, es sei denn sie schaffen es, sich einen Ausweg zu erkaufen. Die Reichen können sich Tausende von Jahren und somit ewige Jugend und Unsterblichkeit erkaufen, während die Armen betteln, leihen und Minute für Minute stehlen, nur um den Tag zu überstehen. 

In dieser Welt ist Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) einer der weniger Glücklichen. Jeden Tag erwacht er mit nicht mehr als 23 Stunden auf seiner tickenden Lebensuhr und seine Zeit läuft ab. Jeden Tag muss er genug Zeit verdienen, um den nächsten Morgen zu erleben. 

Als jedoch ein reicher Fremder in sein Leben tritt und kurz darauf stirbt, wird Will fälschlicherweise des Mordes bezichtigt. Plötzlich ist er auf der Flucht - zusammen mit der attraktiven Geisel Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried). 

Von jetzt an leben die beiden von Minute zu Minute, und ihre Liebe wird zum wichtigsten Instrument im Kampf gegen das korrupte System.

The film is the sequel to Johnny English (2003), and is written by and starring Rowan Atkinson reprising his role as the title character and directed by Oliver Parker.

Plot
The film takes place 8 years after its predecessor and since then, Sir Johnny English's career has had a turn for the worse. Five years before the beginning of the film, he was sent on a mission in Mozambique which went terribly wrong. Since then, he has been living in a cave located somewhere in Tibet, hiding in shame, regret and recrimination due to the mission's failure. The film begins with him still at an all time low in terms of morale. He is then approached by the head monk at a nearby monastery who decides to train him in martial arts, until one day he is given one more chance. The British Intelligence Service, MI7, calls him back to London for a new mission: several rogue Southeast Asian nations have begun to develop nuclear weapons and they require him to ensure that China is on their side. Thus they need him to foil a plot by a band of assassins to kill the Chinese Premier.

CEVkp5Je7m0,Abduction (2011 Movie) - Official Trailer - Taylor Lautner),Lionsgate Movies,UCJ6nMHaJPZvsJ-HmUmj1SeA,"A young man unwittingly thrust into a deadly world of covert espionage.

For as long as he can remember, Nathan Harper (Taylor Lautner) has had the uneasy feeling that he's living someone else's life. When he stumbles upon an image of himself as a little boy on a missing persons website, all of Nathan's darkest fears come true: he realizes his parents are not his own and his life is a lie, carefully fabricated to hide something more mysterious and dangerous than he could have ever imagined. 

Just as he begins to piece together his true identity, Nathan is targeted by a team of trained killers, forcing him on the run with the only person he can trust, his neighbor, Karen (Lily Collins). Every second counts as Nathan and Karen race to evade an army of assassins and federal operatives. But as his opponents close in, Nathan realizes that the only way he'll survive -- and solve the mystery of his elusive biological father -- is to stop running and take matters into his own hands. 

Starring: Taylor Lautner, Lily Collins, Alfred Molina, Jason Issacs, Maria Bello, Michael Nyqvist and Sigourney Weaver.

Starring Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland, Stanley Tucci, Lenny Kravitz, Willow Shields. 

Every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the evil Capitol of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games.  A twisted punishment for a past uprising and an ongoing government intimidation tactic, The Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which ""Tributes"" must fight with one another until one survivor remains. 
 
Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy.  If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.
 
The Hunger Games is directed by Gary Ross, with a screenplay by Gary Ross and Suzanne Collins and Billy Ray, and produced by Nina Jacobson's Color Force in tandem with producer Jon Kilik. Suzanne Collins' best-selling novel, the first in a trilogy published by Scholastic that has over 23.5 million copies in print in the United States alone, has developed a massive global following.

Starring Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Willow Shields, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone, Natalie Dormer, with Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland.

The blockbuster Hunger Games franchise has taken audiences by storm around the world, grossing more than $2.2 billion at the global box office. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 now brings the franchise to its powerful final chapter in which Katniss Everdeen [Jennifer Lawrence] realizes the stakes are no longer just for survival – they are for the future.

With the nation of Panem in a full scale war, Katniss confronts President Snow [Donald Sutherland] in the final showdown. Teamed with a group of her closest friends – including Gale [Liam Hemsworth], Finnick [Sam Claflin], and Peeta [Josh Hutcherson] – Katniss goes off on a mission with the unit from District 13 as they risk their lives to liberate the citizens of Panem, and stage an assassination attempt on President Snow who has become increasingly obsessed with destroying her. The mortal traps, enemies, and moral choices that await Katniss will challenge her more than any arena she faced in The Hunger Games.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 is directed by Francis Lawrence from a screenplay by Peter Craig and Danny Strong and features an acclaimed cast including Academy Award®-winner Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Academy Award®-winner Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Willow Shields, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone with Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland reprising their original roles from The Hunger Games and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire... Coming to theaters November 22nd, 2013. 
Visit http://www.TheHungerGames.Movie

THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE begins as Katniss Everdeen has returned home safe after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark. Winning means that they must turn around and leave their family and close friends, embarking on a ""Victor's Tour"" of the districts. Along the way Katniss senses that a rebellion is simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games (The Quarter Quell) - a competition that could change Panem forever. 

THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE is directed by Francis Lawrence, from a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Michael DeBruyn, based upon the novel ""Catching Fire"" by Suzanne Collins and produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik. The novel is the second in a trilogy that has over 50 million copies in print in the U.S. alone. THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE opens on November 22, 2013.

Sherlock Holmes has always been the smartest man in the room...until now. There is a new criminal mastermind at large--Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris)--and not only is he Holmes' intellectual equal, but his capacity for evil, coupled with a complete lack of conscience, may actually give him an advantage over the renowned detective. When the Crown Prince of Austria is found dead, the evidence, as construed by Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan), points to suicide. But Sherlock Holmes deduces that the prince has been the victim of murder--a murder that is only one piece of a larger and much more portentous puzzle, designed by one Professor Moriarty. Mixing business with pleasure, Holmes tracks the clues to an underground gentlemen's club, where he and his brother, Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) are toasting Dr. Watson on his last night of bachelorhood. It is there that Holmes encounters Sim (Noomi Rapace), a Gypsy fortune teller, who sees more than she is telling and whose unwitting involvement in the prince's murder makes her the killer's next target. Holmes barely manages to save her life and, in return, she reluctantly agrees to help him. The investigation becomes ever more dangerous as it leads Holmes, Watson and Sim across the continent, from England to France to Germany and finally to Switzerland. But the cunning Moriarty is always one step ahead as he spins a web of death and destruction--all part of a greater plan that, if he succeeds, will change the course of history. Filmmaker Guy Ritchie returns to direct ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,"" the follow-up to the smash hit ""Sherlock Holmes."" The sequel also reunites producers Joel Silver, Lionel Wigram, Susan Downey and Dan Lin. Bruce Berman serves as executive producer, with Steve Clark-Hall co-producing. Jared Harris (TV's ""Mad Men,"" ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") joins the cast as the notorious Professor Moriarty. Also joining the cast, in her first English-speaking role, is Swedish actress Noomi Rapace, who gained international attention in the Swedish film ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" Stephen Fry (""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"") plays Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's older brother. Additional cast members returning from the first film include Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade; Kelly Reilly as Watson's bride, Mary Morstan; and Geraldine James as Holmes's long-suffering landlady, Mrs. Hudson.

Na7sbnvpTHU,PoM~Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows trailer,GwinverArRouz,UCNH0p5oGWWSwspv_oIFLTXA,"FINALLY DONE! Riconator, if you read this, thank you very much for your encouraging words. ^^
 Phew, this trailer was hard to do... Even if a few scenes are not so well chosen, I'm proud of myself right now. ^^ (not sure if I'll still be in a few weeks though...)
Well, this is the trailer of Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, as I promised. Some parts were quite fun to do, especially when Sherlock said « no pressure » (since Kowalski said that too in « It's about time »): easiest lip-synching in the whole trailer! XD
Anyway, I really liked doing a SH trailer again, with Kowalski and Private as the main characters. And Blowhole as Moriarty, of course. Who else could play this criminal genius? Kitka is Simza, a gypsy fortune-teller and Hunter is Private's wife. ...Uhh... The choice of these characters wasn't easy, since I've already used Marlene as Irene Adler in my previous trailer. It works, I guess (but if they made another sequel, I would run out of ideas...).

Anyway, here are the characters :

Sherlock Holmes : Kowalski
Dr. John Watson : Private
Professor James Moriarty : Dr. Blowhole
Simza : Kitka
Mary ( Dr. Watson's wife) : Hunter
Irene Adler : Marlene

I hope you like it!

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Ex-CIA agent turned criminal, Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), is attacked by a team of mercenaries after he aquires important files from another agent (Liam Cunningham).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
A rookie CIA operative goes on the run with a rogue former intelligence officer after a South African safe house comes under attack by heavily armed mercenaries. Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a CIA agent just waiting for the perfect opportunity to prove himself. But that's no easy task when you've been cooped up in an empty Cape Town safe house for a whole year. Weston realizes that a prime opportunity is headed his way, however, when he learns that former agent Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) has been captured after nearly a decade on the run. Frost is about to become Weston's one and only guest at the safe house, and the fledgling agent is determined to handle the situation like a true professional. But by selling U.S. secrets to countries like North Korea, Frost has made more than his fair share of enemies in high places, and shortly after he arrives at the safe house, all hell breaks loose. A small army of gunmen are determined to see Frost dead. Meanwhile, Weston will do everything in his power to protect Frost, regardless of his crimes. Now Weston's only hope for getting out of this alive is to find out who's gunning for them, and seek out someone he can trust before it's too late.

Development
On February 9, 2007, Marvel producer Avi Arad announced the development of Ghost Rider 2 at a press event. Peter Fonda has also expressed a desire to return as Mephistopheles. In early December, 2007, Nicolas Cage also has expressed interest to return in the lead role as Ghost Rider. Shortly after, in another interview he went on further to mention that he would enjoy seeing a darker story, adding, ""He's not eating jelly beans anymore; he's getting drunk"". He suggested that the film could do with newly created villains. It is also rumored that the sequel would feature Danny Ketch, another Marvel character who takes up the Ghost Rider mantle.
In a September 2008 interview, Nicolas Cage informed IGN that Columbia have taken meetings to start a sequel. Cage noted conversations about the story, where Ghost Rider may end up in Europe on behalf of the church, having story elements ""very much in the zeitgeist, like Da Vinci Code."" In February 2009, an online source stated Columbia Pictures had greenlit a sequel to Ghost Rider. Nicolas Cage will reprise the lead role, whilst the studio are in search of writers. On September 23, 2009, it was reported that David S. Goyer signed on to write the script for the sequel. Goyer spoke to MTV about the sequel, stating that the story will pick up eight years after the events of the first film and that he hopes to start filming by 2010. The sequel is entitled Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and will be produced by Mike De Luca and will screen with a PG-13 rating. On July 14, 2010 it was confirmed that Nicolas Cage would return, and Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor were in negotiations to direct.

Filming
In July 2010 Cage revealed shooting was to start in November. In an interview with Superhero Hype!, Eva Mendes revealed that she would not be back as Roxanne for the sequel. The film will be shot in 3-D in Romania and Turkey. The film started principal photography in Bucharest, Romania in November 2010.[2] Principal photography was completed on January 24, 2011. On March 16, 2011, it was confirmed that Johnny Whitworth would be playing the antagonist, which was also confirmed to be Blackout.

After making their way through high school (twice), big changes are in store for officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) when they go deep undercover at a local college. But when Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football team, and Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene, they begin to question their partnership. Now they don't have to just crack the case - they have to figure out if they can have a mature relationship. If these two overgrown adolescents can grow from freshmen into real men, college might be the best thing that ever happened to them.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Zeus (Liam Neeson), Perseus (Sam Worthington), and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) use their power and might to defeat the volcanic monster Kronos.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The epic battle between the Titans and the gods continues in this sequel set ten years after the events in Clash of the Titans, as Perseus (Sam Worthington) descends into the underworld on a mission to rescue Zeus from the clutches of Hades (Ralph Fiennes), Ares (Edgar Ramirez), and Kronos. In the wake of his decisive victory against the Kraken, Perseus has retreated to a remote fishing village to raise his young son, Helius. Meanwhile, humanity has lost faith in the gods. As a result, Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon find their power beginning to slip, a development that could spell disaster for all of humankind should their imprisoned father, Kronos, manage to break free from his underworld prison in Tartarus. When Perseus learns that Zeus' son Ares has teamed with Hades and Kronos to capture Zeus, steal his power, and create hell on earth, the time comes to take action. Now, with Andromeda (Rosamund Pike), Argenor (Toby Kebbell), and Hephaestus (Bill Nighy) by his side, brave Perseus will venture deep into the underworld on a mission to defeat the Titans, deliver Zeus from evil, and prevent the powers of darkness from consuming all of humanity.

After fighting his way out of a building filled with gangsters and madmen - a fight that left the bodies of police and gangsters alike piled in the halls - rookie Jakarta cop Rama thought it was done and he could resume a normal life. He couldn't have been more wrong. Formidable though they may have been, Rama's opponents in that fateful building were nothing more than small fish swimming in a pond much larger than he ever dreamed possible. And his triumph over the small fry has attracted the attention of the predators farther up the food chain. His family at risk, Rama has only one choice to protect his infant son and wife: He must go undercover to enter the criminal underworld himself and climb through the hierarchy of competing forces until it leads him to the corrupt politicians and police pulling the strings at the top of the heap. And so Rama begins a new odyssey of violence, a journey that will force him to set aside his own life and history and take on a new identity as the violent offender ""Yuda."" In prison he must gain the confidence of Uco - the son of a prominent gang kingpin - to join the gang himself, laying his own life on the line in a desperate all-or-nothing gambit to bring the whole rotten enterprise to an end.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Marty Mikalski (Fran Kranz) and Dana (Kristen Connolly) open the doors of hell, allowing creatures of all sorts to bounce out, pounce, and kill.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard team up for this bloody horror satire that offers an inventive twist on the familiar stranded-in-the-woods sub-genre. As five friends pile into an RV bound for a secluded cabin far from civilization, the operators of a mysterious, high-tech control room monitor their every move while preparing an arcane ritual that dates back to the beginning of time. Shortly after arriving at the rickety cottage, Dana (Kristen Connolly) and her friends Curt (Chris Hemsworth), Jules (Anna Hutchison), Marty (Fran Kranz), and Holden (Jesse Willaims) venture into the basement and discover a little girl's diary from the early 1900s -- which recounts a series of horrifying events that unfolded precisely where the vacationing teens how stand. Before long, the nightmare comes knocking at the door -

https://KinoCheck.de | http://fb.com/KinoCheck
Ein entspanntes Wochenende in einer Hütte im Wald, in der Mitte von Nirgendwo
soll es werden, fernab der Zivilisation und jeglicher Beobachtung, kein
Handy-Empfang, kein Internet, kein Mensch weit und breit. Nur fünf Freunde
und die Natur -- ein Abenteuer, ein großer Spaß. Selbst die Warnungen eines
bedrohlich wirkenden Tankwarts können die Vorfreude nicht dämpfen. Zunächst
wirkt die Hütte auch wie die Erfüllung aller Verheißungen. Doch dann
entdecken die Freunde den verborgenen Zugang zu einem Keller -- und als die
Neugier gegen die Vernunft siegt, gehen sie zu fünft die knarzende Treppe
hinab ins Dunkel... Gleichzeitig sitzen zwei Wissenschaftler weit entfernt in
einem geheimen Labor tief unter der Erde und drücken ein paar Knöpfe...

Fünf Freunde in einer entlegenen Hütte im Wald. Schlimme Dinge passieren.
Alles klar? Eben nicht: Gemeinsam mit Erfolgsproduzent und -autor Joss Whedon
(„Marvel's The Avengers"", „Buffy -- Im Bann der Dämonen"") hat Regisseur Drew
Goddard („Lost"", „Alias"") ein ebenso raffiniertes wie teuflisches Szenario
erdacht, das alle Regeln des Horrorfilms erfüllt -- und gleichzeitig dennoch
genial auf den Kopf stellt. Die Hauptrollen in diesem von der Kritik
euphorisch gefeierten Trip in eine Hölle, wie man sie im Kino noch nie
gesehen hat, spielen Hollywoods aktuell heißester Topstar Chris Hemsworth
(„Marvel's The Avengers"", „Thor""), Richard Jenkins („Freunde mit gewissen

Release Date: March 16, 2012
Choreographed by: Paul Becker
Directed by: Tarsem Singh
Written by: Melisa Wallack, Jason Keller

Mirror Mirror is a spectacular reimagining of the classic fairy tale starring Oscar winner Julia Roberts as the Queen, Lily Collins (The Blind Side) as Snow White, Armie Hammer (The Social Network) as Prince Alcott, Sean Bean (""The Game of Thrones"", The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) as the King and Nathan Lane (The Lion King, The Birdcage) as the Queen's hapless and bungling servant, Brighton.  An evil queen steals control of a kingdom and an exiled princess enlists the help of seven resourceful rebels to win back her birthright in a spirited adventure comedy filled with jealousy, romance and betrayal that will capture the imagination of audiences the world over.

Visionary director Tarsem Singh (Immortals) rewrites fairy tale history as a wicked enchantress (Roberts) schemes and scrambles for control of a spirited orphan's (Collins) throne and the attention of a charming prince (Hammer). When Snow White's beauty wins the heart of the prince that she desperately pursues, the Queen banishes her to the forest, where a ravening man-eating beast hungrily awaits. 
 
Rescued by a band of diminutive highway robbers, Snow White grows into an indomitable young woman determined to take back her realm from the treacherous Queen. With the support of her subjects, she roars into action in an epic battle that blends spectacle, magic and contemporary humor in Singh's signature, jaw-dropping visual style.",2011-11-17T19:53:28Z,"['Mirror Mirror', 'Official Trailer', 'Theatrical Trailer', 'Mirror Mirror Trailer', 'Mirror Mirror Trailer 2012', 'Mirror Mirror Official', 'Mirror Mirror 2012', 'Julia Robert', 'Lily Collins', 'Snow White', 'New Snow White Movie', 'Mirror Mirror Movie', 'Official Trailer HD', 'Trailer HD', 'Promo', 'Dance Scene', 'Dance', 'Dancing', 'Sneak Preview', 'Sneak Peek', 'Nathan Lane', 'Armie Hammer']",498628,886,97,181,62764,0.4122807017543859

U.S. Marine Sergeant Logan Thibault (Zac Efron) returns from his third tour of duty in Iraq, with the one thing he credits with keeping him alive—a photograph he found of a woman he doesn't even know. Learning her name is Beth (Taylor Schilling) and where she lives, he shows up at her door, and ends up taking a job at her family-run local kennel. Despite her initial mistrust and the complications in her life, a romance develops between them, giving Logan hope that Beth could be much more than his good luck charm.",2011-12-06T12:44:38Z,"['Zac Efron', 'Logan Thibault', 'Taylor Schilling', 'Beth Clayton', 'Blythe Danner', 'Jay R.

Dark Shadows Official Trailer #1 - Johnny Depp, Tim Burton Movie (2012) HD

In the year 1752, Joshua and Naomi Collins, with young son Barnabas, set sail from Liverpool, England to start a new life in America. But even an ocean was not enough to escape the mysterious curse that has plagued their family. Two decades pass and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) has the world at his feet--or at least the town of Collinsport, Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets. Matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) has called upon live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), to help with her family troubles. Also residing in the manor is Elizabeth's ne'er-do-well brother, Roger Collins, (Jonny Lee Miller); her rebellious teenage daughter Carolyn Stoddard (Chloe Moretz); and Roger's precocious 10-year-old son, David Collins (Gulliver McGrath). The mystery extends beyond the family, to caretaker Willie Loomis, played by Jackie Earle Haley, and David's new nanny, Victoria Winters, played by Bella Heathcote.",2012-03-16T17:28:03Z,"['Dark Shadows movie', 'Dark Shadows trailer', 'Dark Shadows HD', 'Dark Shadows tv show', 'Tim Burton', 'Johnny Depp', 'Michelle Pfeiffer', 'Helena Bonham Carter', 'Jackie Earle Haley', 'Jonny Lee Miller', 'Eva Green', 'Chloe Moretz', 'Bella Heathcote', 'Thomas McDonell', 'Gulliver McGrath', 'movieclips', 'movie', 'clips', 'movieclipsDOTcom', 'movieclipstrailers', 'popuptrailer']",2337235,18493,456,778,62213,0.2849099099099099

aiwcHd7ZmTo,DARK SHADOWS - TRAILER (GREEK SUBS),VILLAGE,UCWs6goyS_DHeCq80zaMmEcw,"Κάθε νέα ταινία του Τιμ Μπάρτον είναι από μόνη της ένα κινηματογραφικό γεγονός. Πόσο μάλλον, όταν η επόμενη ταινία του αναγνωρισμένου σκηνοθέτη αποτελεί remake μιας από τις πιο cult τηλεοπτικές σαπουνόπερες της δεκαετίας του 1960. Το 1752, ο Τζόσουα και η Ναόμι Κόλινς, μαζί με τον γιο τους Μπαρνάμπας, αποφασίζουν να μετοικίσουν, από το Λίβερπουλ της Αγγλίας, στην Αμερική. Ακόμα κι ένας ωκεανός, όμως, δεν είναι αρκετός, για να δραπετεύσουν από την κατάρα που καταδιώκει την οικογένεια τους. Δυο δεκαετίες μετά, ο Μπαρνάμπας (Τζόνι Ντεπ) έχει τον κόσμο στα πόδια του... ή τουλάχιστον την πόλη του Κόλινσπορτ, στο Μέιν. Άρχοντας της έπαυλης των Κόλινγουντ, ο Μπαρνάμπας είναι πλούσιος, πανίσχυρος και ένας ακαταμάχητος πλέιμποϊ... μέχρι που κάνει το μεγάλο λάθος να ραγίσει την καρδιά της Αντζελίκ Μπουσάρ (Έύα Γκριν). Μάγισσα, με κάθε σημασία της λέξης, η Αντζελίκ τον καταδικάζει σε μια μοίρα χειρότερη από τον θάνατο: τον μεταμορφώνει σε βρικόλακα και μετά τον θάβει ζωντανό. Δυο αιώνες μετά, ο Μπαρνάμπας ελευθερώνεται κατά λάθος από τον τάφο του, και βγαίνει στο 1972, έναν κόσμο πολύ διαφορετικό από τον δικό του. Επιστρέφει στην Έπαυλη των Κόλινγουντ, μόνο για να ανακαλύψει ότι η περιουσία του είναι κατεστραμμένη. Τα δυσλειτουργικά απομεινάρια των Κόλινς, δεν έχουν πολύ καλύτερη τύχη, καθώς ο καθένας του έχει τα δικά του σκοτεινά μυστικά. Η μητριαρχική φιγούρα των Κόλινς, η Ελίζαμπεθ Κόλινς Στόνταρντ (Μισέλ Φάιφερ) έχει καλέσει την ψυχίατρο, Δρ. Τζούλια Χόφμαν (Έλενα Μπόμαν Κάρτερ), για να βοηθήσει με τα προβλήματα της οικογένειας της. Στην έπαυλη μένουν, επίσης, ο αδερφός της Ελίζαμπεθ, Ρότζερ Κόλινς (Τζόνι Λι Μίλερ), η θρησκευόμενη έφηβη κόρη της, Κάρολιν Στόνταρντ (Κλόι Μόρετζ) και ο δεκάχρονος γιος του Ρότζερ, Ντέιβιντ Κόλινς (Γκιούλιβερ ΜακΓκράθ).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The Men in Black are back, and this time Agent J (Will Smith) must take a trip into the past in order to save both the future and his taciturn partner Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) in the third installment of the hit sci-fi comedy series. After 15 years of working with aliens from all across the cosmos, Agent J is sure he's seen it all. But just when he's getting the hang of the game, he learns that history has inexplicably been rewritten. In this new timeline of events, Agent K has been dead for 40 years, and Earth will soon come under attack from an extraterrestrial force with the power to claim the entire planet. Now, in order to set the past straight and head off an invasion of epic proportions, Agent J must travel back to the year 1969, when Young Agent K (Josh Brolin) was just a fresh new face on the force. But Agent J only has 24 hours to find the source of the coming catastrophe and discern how his longtime partner ties into the situation -- should he fail he'll be stuck in the past forever.

Chris Hemsworth and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron return to their roles from Snow White and the Huntsman, joined by Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain.

Theron stars as evil Queen Ravenna, who betrays her good sister Freya (Blunt) with an unforgivable act, freezing Freya’s heart to love and unleashing in her an icy power she never knew she possessed.  Retreating to a kingdom far to the north, Freya raises an army of Huntsmen as her protectors, with the only rule that no two of them should ever fall in love.

As a war for domination escalates between the two queens, the hero standing between them is Freya’s most elite Huntsman, Eric (Hemsworth).  Alongside fellow warrior Sara (Chastain)—the only woman who has ever captured his heart—Eric must help Freya vanquish her sister…or Ravenna’s wickedness will rule for eternity. 
 
Producer Joe Roth (Maleficent, Alice in Wonderland) once again leads the team in this breathtaking prequel in the legendary saga that is directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan.  This spring, find out who will win the war between good and evil in the epic action-adventure The Huntsman: Winter’s War.

Basada en la preadolescencia y hecha desde una conmovedora intensidad emocional. La película ofrece un final feliz a esa historia frustrada de amor. Sam y Suzy tienen 12 años están hechos el uno para el otro, y preparados para fugarse de casa y perderse en un bosque encantado en el que todo --unos prismáticos, unos pendientes hechos con dos escarabajos, un tocadiscos a pilas-- forma parte del espectáculo del amor puro. Tanto niños como adultos necesitan pertenecer a una familia, no importa si ésta toma la forma de un grupo de escoltas. Lo que importa es la filiación, sentirse parte de un todo, de la lógica de un sistema que nos protege y nos hiere a la vez.. S.Sánchez

Wie schon in dem Welthit „Magic Mike“ von 2012 spielen auch in „Magic Mike XXL“ Channing Tatum, Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello, Kevin Nash, Adam Rodriguez und Gabriel Iglesias die Hauptrollen. Drei Jahre sind vergangen, seit Mike sich auf dem Höhepunkt seiner Karriere als Stripper verabschiedet hat: In „Magic Mike XXL“ sind inzwischen auch die übrigen Kings of Tampa bereit, das Handtuch zu werfen. Aber sie machen das auf ihre Art – es soll ein unheimlich starker Abgang mit einer letzten überwältigenden Performance in Myrtle Beach werden, wobei ihr legendärer Star Magic Mike mit ihnen auftreten soll.

It's great to be Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). For Peter Parker, there's no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen (Emma Stone). But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: OsCorp.

But when the procedure goes horribly wrong, Quaid becomes a hunted man.

Dick’s short novel, We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, TOTAL RECALL is a truly visionary film ahead of its time. Featuring a career best performance from the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger, the sci-fi classic film was restored in 4K from a scan of the original 35mm negative and was made at Technicolor LA in tiff 16 bits format. 

One of the earliest films to use computer generated-images, TOTAL RECALL was honoured with the Academy Award® for Special Achievement Award for Visual Effects in 1991, and those effects have impressively stood the test of time. 

The film has been selected to premiere at the upcoming Deauville American Film Festival (4-13 September 2020) as well as Sitges, International Fantastic Film Festival of Catalonia (8-18 October 2020).

qv-6dNqqnMA,Dredd 3D (2012) - Official Trailer #2,Lionsgate Movies,UCJ6nMHaJPZvsJ-HmUmj1SeA,"The future America is an irradiated waste land. On its East Coast, running from Boston to Washington DC, lies Mega City One- a vast, violent metropolis where criminals rule the chaotic streets. The only force of order lies with the urban cops called ""Judges"" who possess the combined powers of judge, jury and instant executioner. Known and feared throughout the city, Dredd (Karl Urban) is the ultimate Judge, challenged with ridding the city of its latest scourge -- a dangerous drug epidemic that has users of ""Slo-Mo"" experiencing reality at a fraction of its normal speed. 

During a routine day on the job, Dredd is assigned to train and evaluate Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), a rookie with powerful psychic abilities thanks to a genetic mutation. A heinous crime calls them to a neighborhood where fellow Judges rarely dare to venture- a 200 story vertical slum controlled by prostitute turned drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) and her ruthless clan. When they capture one of the clan's inner circle, Ma-Ma overtakes the compound's control center and wages a dirty, vicious war against the Judges that proves she will stop at nothing to protect her empire. With the body count climbing and no way out, Dredd and Anderson must confront the odds and engage in the relentless battle for their survival.

The endlessly inventive mind of writer Alex Garland and director Pete Travis bring DREDD to life as a futuristic neo-noir action film. Filmed in 3D with stunning slow motion photography sequences, the film returns the celebrated character to the dark, visceral incarnation from John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra's revered comic strip.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) chases a trio of Slo-Mo drug addicts, taking down out their van in a spectacular rolling car crash.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
A feared urban cop takes on a vicious city drug dealer in a futuristic metropolis as director Pete Travis (Vantage Point) and screenwriter Alex Garland (28 Days Later, Sunshine) team to bring iconic 2000A.D. lawman Judge Dredd to the big screen. In the future, much of North America has been poisoned by radiation. The sprawling urban jungle Mega City One stretches from Boston to Washington D.C., and in order to keep the growing criminal element in check, police enforcers called ""Judges"" have been given the power of judge, jury, and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is the most feared of them all, delivering death sentences with impunity as he fights to rid the streets of ""Slo-Mo"" -- a powerful new drug that alters its user's perception of time. In the process of training psychic rookie Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), Dredd receives a report of an incident in a sprawling criminal stronghold ruled by fearsome drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), and ventures in to investigate. Upon learning that one of her top men has been captured by Dredd shortly thereafter, an enraged Ma-Ma seizes control of her massive 200-story complex, launching an all-out war against the Judges as Dredd and Cassandra find themselves trapped in the belly of the beast.

2G7wStEd4JE,End Of Watch Official Trailer,Nordisk Film,UC2LzjztyruaONwnZPIGdBAA,"END OF WATCH er en utroligt ærlig, stærk, rå og intens, gribende, dramatisk beretning om familie, venskab, kærlighed, ære og mod. Den tidligere Oscar® nominerede og BAFTA prisvindende Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain (2005)) og Michael Peña spiller hovedrollerne som de unge, entusiastiske politiassistenter Taylor og Zavala, der hver dag i deres black-and-white patruljevogn forsøger at opretholde relativ ro og orden i Los Angeles ubetinget farligste og mest voldsramte gader og stræder i South Central LA. Meget af filmens gribende, subjektive intimitet udspringer af, at meget af historien fortælles via optagelser fra politimændenes egne håndholdte HD kameraer, bilkameraer, overvågningskameraer og bandemedlemmer og almindelige borgeres egne optagelser. Taylor og Zavala bevæger sig konstant og konsekvent i det livsfarlige grænseland mellem bander og borgere og fanges konstant på den forkerte side af alle mulige slags næver, knive og skydevåben. Deres arbejdsområde er storbyens mørkeste, mest voldelige og dårligst oplyste gader og der går ikke en dag uden de sætter deres liv på spil for borgerne og -- ikke mindst -- for hinanden. Men hjemme venter familierne, der er tvunget til at leve under den skygge det er at vide, at ens elskede måske ikke kommer hjem en dag ...

Twelve strangers wake up in a clearing. They don’t know where they are, or how they got there. They don't know they've been chosen… for a very specific purpose… The Hunt.

In the shadow of a dark internet conspiracy theory, a bunch of elites gathers for the very first time at a remote Manor House to hunt humans for sport. But the elites’ master plan is about to be derailed because one of the hunted, Crystal (Betty Gilpin, GLOW), knows The Hunters’ game better than they do. She turns the tables on the killers, picking them off, one by one, as she makes her way toward the mysterious woman (two-time Oscar® winner Hilary Swank) at the center of it all. 

From Jason Blum, the producer of Get Out and The Purge series, and Damon Lindelof, creator of the HBO series Watchmen and co-creator of the TV series Lost, comes a timely and provocative new satirical thriller. 
The Hunt is written by Lindelof and his fellow Watchmen collaborator Nick Cuse and is directed by Craig Zobel (Z for Zachariah, The Leftovers).

The Hunt es un 'thriller' de acción dirigido por Craig Zobel (Z for Zachariah) y que cuenta con un guion de Damon Lindelof, co-creador de la mítica serie Perdidos, junto con Nick Cuse (The Leftovers).
Doce extraños se despiertan en el claro de un bosque con muchas preguntas sin respuesta. ¿Dónde están? ¿Cómo llegaron allí? ¿Y por qué o con qué propósito están ahí? La respuesta a todas esas preguntas es: La caza, un juego macabro ideado por miembros de las élites globales, que se reunen en un punto remoto o una casa para cazar humanos por diversión. Ellos son las presas; el resto, los cazadores.
Pero todo está a punto de cambiar cuando Crystal (Betty Gilpin), una de las jóvenes que se encuentra entre los ""cazados"", le da la vuelta al juego y empieza a inclinar la balanza a su favor. Uno a uno, comienza a deshacerse de los miembros de la élite que pretende darles caza, con la intención de llegar hasta la misteriosa mujer (Hilary Swank) que mueve los hilos de todo aquello.

Victor und sein Hund Sparky sind beste Freunde. Doch eines Tages wird Sparky von einem Auto angefahren und stirbt. Der Tod seines geliebten Hundes macht Victor sehr zu schaffen, weshalb er die Macht der Wissenschaft nutzt, um ihn nach Frankensteins Art wieder ins Leben zu rufen - leider nicht mit dem gewünschten Ergebnis: Denn an Stelle des niedlichen Hundes erweckt er ein deformiertes Monster zum Leben. 

Zunächst versucht er seine eigene Kreatur zu verstecken, doch als es dem neuen Sparky gelingt aus dem Haus zu kommen, geraten Viktors Mitschüler, die Lehrer sowie die gesamte Stadt in Panik. Nun liegt es an Victor, den Menschen klar zu machen, dass Sparky trotz seines gewöhnungsbedürftigen Aussehens immer noch der gleiche friedliche Hund ist, der er immer war.

Synopsis:
The Drac pack is back for an all-new monster comedy adventure in Sony Pictures Animation's Hotel Transylvania 2!  Everything seems to be changing for the better at Hotel Transylvania...  Dracula’s rigid monster-only hotel policy has finally relaxed, opening up its doors to human guests. But behind closed coffins, Drac is worried that his adorable half-human, half-vampire grandson, Dennis, isn’t showing signs of being a vampire. So while Mavis is busy visiting her human in-laws with Johnny – and in for a major cultural shock of her own – “Vampa” Drac enlists his friends Frank, Murray, Wayne and Griffin to put Dennis through a “monster-in-training” boot camp.  But little do they know that Drac’s grumpy and very old, old, old school dad Vlad is about to pay a family visit to the hotel.  And when Vlad finds out that his great-grandson is not a pure blood – and humans are now welcome at Hotel Transylvania – things are going to get batty!

Wreck-It Ralph (voice of Reilly) longs to be as beloved as his game's perfect Good Guy, Fix-It Felix (voice of McBrayer). Problem is, nobody loves a Bad Guy. But they do love heroes... so when a modern, first-person shooter game arrives featuring tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun (voice of Lynch), Ralph sees it as his ticket to heroism and happiness. He sneaks into the game with a simple plan—win a medal—but soon wrecks everything, and accidently unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens every game in the arcade. Ralph's only hope? Vanellope von Schweetz (voice of Silverman), a young troublemaking ""glitch"" from a candy-coated cart racing game who might just be the one to teach Ralph what it means to be a Good Guy. But will he realize he is good enough to become a hero before it's ""Game Over"" for the entire arcade?",2012-09-13T16:00:13Z,"['Walt', 'Disney', 'Animation', 'Studios', 'Motion', 'Pictures', 'John', 'Reilly', 'Jack', 'McBrayer', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'Rich', 'Moore', 'Teaser', 'Trailer', 'HD', 'Movie', '1080p', 'Video', 'Games', 'Nintendo', 'Wii', 'Sega', 'Playstation', 'XBox', 'Bowser', 'Mario', 'Bros', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'Bison', 'Zangief', 'Q*Bert', 'Game', 'Central', 'Station', 'Jump', ""Hero's"", 'Duty', 'Sugar', 'Rush', 'Fix', 'It', 'Felix', 'Jr', 'Animated', 'CG', '3D', 'November', 'Fall', 'Debut', 'Premiere', 'Pac', 'Man', 'Clyde', 'Bad', 'Guys', 'Funny', 'comedy', 'Official Trailer', 'Sonic', 'the', 'hedgehog', 'NeoTVWIRVideos', 'WIRNetGear11212', 'Frogger', 'Dig', 'Dug', 'Root', 'Beer', 'Tapper']",10689086,26597,1947,1,82690,0.5571305841924399

“Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2” leaves Litwak’s video arcade behind, venturing into the uncharted, expansive and thrilling world of the internet—which may or may not survive Ralph’s wrecking. Video game bad guy Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly) and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (voice of Sarah Silverman) must risk it all by traveling to the world wide web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope’s video game, Sugar Rush. In way over their heads, Ralph and Vanellope rely on the citizens of the internet—the netizens—to help navigate their way, including a webite entrepreneur named Yesss (voice of Taraji P. Henson), who is the head algorithm and the heart and soul of trend-making site “BuzzzTube.” Directed by Rich Moore (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph”) and Phil Johnston (co-writer “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Cedar Rapids,” co-writer “Zootopia,”), and produced by Clark Spencer (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Bolt”), “Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-Ralph 2” hits theaters on Nov. 21, 2018.
