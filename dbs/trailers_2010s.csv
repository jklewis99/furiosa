CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Teddy (Leonardo Dicaprio) dreams of his wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio team up for a fourth time for this adaptation of Shutter Island, a novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River). The film opens in 1954 as World War II veteran and current federal marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner, Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), ferry to Shutter Island, a water-bound mental hospital housing the criminally insane. They have been asked to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient admitted to the asylum after she murdered her three children. As Teddy quizzes Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), the head of the institution, he begins to suspect that the authorities in charge might not be giving him the whole truth, and that a terrible fate may befall all the patients in the spooky Ward C -- a unit devoted to the most heinous of the hospital's inmates. Complicating matters further, Teddy has a secret of his own -- the arsonist who murdered his wife is incarcerated on Shutter Island. Driven to confront his wife's killer, and stranded on the island because of a hurricane, Teddy must unravel the secrets of the eerie place before succumbing to his own madness. Max von Sydow, Emily Mortimer, Michelle Williams, Patricia Clarkson, and Jackie Earle Haley round out the supporting cast.

PERCY JACKSON & THE LIGHTNING THIEF, van de maker van Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone en The Chamber of Secrets, speelt zich af in een hedendaagse wereld waar ook de twaalf Griekse Goden van de berg Olympus leven. Deze goden hebben een nieuw ras van jonge, mythische helden gecreëerd, die halfgoden zijn  voor de helft sterfelijk, voor de helft god. 
 
Percy (Logan Lerman) is zo'n halfgod en de zoon van de god Poseidon. Hij wordt er door Zeus (Sean Bean) - de broer van Poseidon - van verdacht zijn bliksemschicht te hebben gestolen, het machtigste wapen van het hele universum. Percy gaat op een avontuurlijke en gevaarlijke missie om zijn onschuld te bewijzen en een vernietigende oorlog tussen de goden te voorkomen.
 
Tijdens zijn tocht gaat hij de strijd aan met machtige vijanden die vastbesloten zijn hem tegen te houden. Ook leidt zijn tocht hem naar de onderwereld waar hij zijn moeder uit de dodelijke klauwen van zijn vaders grootste vijand: Hades (de god van de onderwereld) moet zien te redden. De rol van Medusa wordt vertolkt door Uma Thurman en Pierce Brosnan speelt Chiron, een belangrijk sleutelfiguur voor Percy en zijn missie.
 
PERCY JACKSON & THE LIGHTNING THIEF is gebaseerd op het eerste boek van de succesvolle Amerikaanse bestseller-reeks PERCY JACKSON.

Erinnerungen sind trügerisch. Wenn uns unsere nicht täuschen, gab es auf der letztjährigen gamescom nur sehr wenige, große Neuankündigungen. Eines davon müsste Remember Me gewesen sein, welches sich mit ein paar wenigen Screenshots und einem Trailer der breiten Öffentlichkeit präsentierte. Dann tauchte die Erinnerungsjägerin Nilin für kurze Zeit unter und machte erst wieder im September auf sich aufmerksam. Seitdem war es nun still um das kommende Action-Adventure. Und kaum sind die Erinnerungen an Neo-Paris verblasst, veröffentlichte Capcom heute endlich neues Videomaterial.
 
Remember Me lässt euch in die Rolle von Nilin schlüpfen, die im futuristischen Neo-Paris nach ihren Erinnerungen sucht. Das wird sich deshalb als schwierig erweisen, weil in der Welt, in der Nilin lebt, Erinnerungen wie Waren sind. Sie sind frei verfügbar, können gelöscht, verändert und verkauft werden. Manche Menschen sind sogar wie Junkies süchtig von der neuen Technologie geworden, die als Implantat im Nacken herumgetragen wird. Ab Mai 2013 können wir uns dann auch endlich davon überzeugen, ob Remember Me ein Spiel ist, an dass man sich gerne zurückerinnert. Es wird für PlayStation 3 und Xbox 360 erscheinen.

• An der Seite von Hauptcharakterin Nilin geht es im brandneuen Gameplay-Video zu Capcoms „Remember Me"" durch den Stadtteil St. Michel in Neo-Paris.

• Dort trifft sie auf einen der Bossgegner, namens Kid Xmas. Dieser macht aber einen eher wenig weihnachtlichen Eindruck: Ihn interessiert es nicht, ob Nilin artig war -- vielmehr will er sie live im Neo-Paris TV Network vernichten.

Remember Me erscheint im Mai 2013 für Xbox 360, PS3 und PC

(Capcom)

How To Train Your Dragon 2 Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Animation Sequel HD

It's been five years since Hiccup and Toothless successfully united dragons and vikings on the island of Berk. While Astrid, Snoutlout and the rest of the gang are challenging each other to dragon races (the island's new favorite contact sport), the now inseparable pair journey through the skies, charting unmapped territories and exploring new worlds. When one of their adventures leads to the discovery of a secret ice cave that is home to hundreds of new wild dragons and the mysterious Dragon Rider, the two friends find themselves at the center of a battle to protect the peace. Now, Hiccup and Toothless must unite to stand up for what they believe while recognizing that only together do they have the power to change the future of both men and dragons.

From the studio that brought you 'Shrek,' 'Madagascar' and 'Kung Fu Panda' comes 'How to Train Your Dragon.' Set in the mythical world of burly Vikings and wild dragons, and based on the book by Cressida Cowell, the action comedy tells the story of Hiccup, a Viking teenager who doesn't exactly fit in with his tribe's longstanding tradition of heroic dragon slayers. Hiccup's world is turned upside down when he encounters a dragon that challenges he and his fellow Vikings to see the world from an entirely different point of view.","['how', 'to', 'train', 'your', 'dragon', '3d', 'march', '2010', 'challenges', 'vikings', 'world', 'hiccup', 'cressida', 'cowell', 'simon', 'dragons', 'book', 'mythical', 'creature', 'slayer', 'slayers', 'kung', 'fu', 'panda', 'shrek', 'madagascar', 'squidoo', 'google', 'movie', 'film', 'trailer', 'official', 'hollywood', 'youtube', 'adwords', 'casino', 'funny', 'laugh', 'fun', 'kids', 'children', 'theater', 'theatre', 'usa', 'english', 'house', 'helmet', 'hat', 'armour', 'old', 'historic', 'animation', 'cartoon', 'draw', 'drawn', 'held', 'ps3', 'teaser', 'horror movie', 'actors', 'tough guys', 'widescreen', 'anime', 'science fiction', 'movie trailer']",168963,534,27,0,10191,0.5794753086419753

From DreamWorks Animation comes a surprising tale about growing up, finding the courage to face the unknown…and how nothing can ever train you to let go.  What began as an unlikely friendship between an adolescent Viking and a fearsome Night Fury dragon has become an epic adventure spanning their lives.  Welcome to the most astonishing chapter of one of the most beloved animated franchises in film history: How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.  

Now chief and ruler of Berk alongside Astrid, Hiccup has created a gloriously chaotic dragon utopia.  When the sudden appearance of female Light Fury coincides with the darkest threat their village has ever faced, Hiccup and Toothless must leave the only home they’ve known and journey to a hidden world thought only to exist in myth.  As their true destines are revealed, dragon and rider will fight together—to the very ends of the Earth—to protect everything they’ve grown to treasure.

For How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, series director Dean DeBlois returns alongside the all-star cast.  The film is produced by Brad Lewis (Ratatouille, ANTZ) and Bonnie Arnold (Toy Story, How to Train Your Dragon,How to Train Your Dragon 2).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
As Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) owns up to being Iron Man before the world press, Anton Vanko lies dying in Russia. Years ago, Anton worked with Tony's father to create a new source of energy. But greed got the best of Anton, and now as he slips away, his son, Ivan (Mickey Rourke), vows to make Tony pay for the sins of his father. Meanwhile, Tony fends off efforts from smarmy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) and military weapons expert Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) to get him to divulge the secrets of his powerful Iron Man suit. The powers that be are concerned that Tony's technology may fall into the wrong hands -- fears that are soon confirmed when the cocky billionaire entrepreneur is confronted in front of the entire world by Ivan, who has built his own weapon using stolen Stark blueprints. Later, as Lt. Rhodes (Don Cheadle) wrestles with the decision to personally deliver Tony's suit to the military, Ivan finds an unlikely ally in the quest to destroy Iron Man; Stark Industries legal consultant Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) reveals her connection to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson); and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) takes on some new responsibilities.

Birth of a legend. Following King Richard's death in France, archer Robin Longstride, along with Will Scarlett, Alan-a-Dale and Little John, returns to England. They encounter the dying Robert of Locksley, whose party was ambushed by treacherous Godfrey, who hopes to facilitate a French invasion of England. Robin promises the dying knight he will return his sword to his father Walter in Nottingham. Here Walter encourages him to impersonate the dead man to prevent his land being confiscated by the crown, and he finds himself with Marian, a ready-made wife. Hoping to stir baronial opposition to weak King John and allow an easy French take-over, Godfrey worms his way into the king's service as Earl Marshal of England and brutally invades towns under the pretext of collecting Royal taxes. Can Robin navigate the politics of barons, royals, traitors, and the French?

FILM DESCRIPTION:
A relationship is charted from its promising beginning to its sad collapse in this independent drama from Derek Cianfrance. Dean (Ryan Gosling) meets Cindy (Michelle Williams) when they're in their late teens; he's working for a moving company, she's a college student visiting her elderly grandmother at a home for the elderly. Cindy is dating Bobby (Mike Vogel), her boyfriend from high school, but as she gets to know Dean better, a mutual attraction grows between them. Years later, Dean and Cindy are married and have a daughter, Frankie (Faith Wladyka), but they're clearly not as happy as they once were; Dean loves his daughter but feels distant from his wife, they have to look after an elderly relative (John Doman), and when Cindy bumps into Bobby while running errands, it's clear he still holds a grudge against her. Dean and Cindy go away for a weekend together at a hotel, but it doesn't take long for them to realize that the magic isn't coming back. Blue Valentine received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Trapped in a parachuting tank, the A-Team finds a unique way to save themselves.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Director Joe Carnahan resurrects the popular 1980s-era action series with this explosive reboot following the adventures of four Iraq War veterans who begin a second career as mercenaries for hire. Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith (Liam Neeson), Templeton ""Face"" Peck (Bradley Cooper), B.A. Baracus (Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson), and H.M. ""Howlin' Mad"" Murdock (Sharlto Copley) are a group of former Special Forces operatives who have been fighting the good fight for eight years when they're sentenced to military prison for a crime they didn't commit. Breaking out with relative ease, they embark on a treacherous quest to clear their names while being hunted across the globe by Charissa Sosa (Jessica Biel), a high-ranking military officer and one of Face's many former lovers. Meanwhile, mysterious CIA operative Lynch (Patrick Wilson) offers tips that help point the federal fugitives in the right direction, which seems to lead straight to former military contractor Pike (Brian Bloom), who may have been responsible for setting them up in the first place. Just when it seems that the A-Team has all the evidence needed to prove their innocence, however, they discover that their latest mission is just getting started.

Well, if you\u2019re Shrek, you suddenly wind up a domesticated family man. Instead of scaring villagers away like he used to, a reluctant Shrek now agrees to autograph pitch forks. What\u2019s happened to this ogre\u2019s roar? Longing for the days when he felt like a \u201creal ogre,\u201d Shrek is duped into signing a pact with the smooth\u2014talking dealmaker, Rumpelstiltskin. Shrek suddenly finds himself in a twisted, alternate version of Far Far Away, where ogres are hunted, Rumpelstiltskin is king and Shrek and Fiona have never met. Now, it\u2019s up to Shrek to undo all he\u2019s done in the hopes of saving his friends, restoring his world and reclaiming his one True Love. (Source)

The continuing adventures of the big, green ogre Shrek and his buddies, living in the land of Far, Far Away. (Source)

A domesticated Shrek hatches a plan to recapture his mojo and discovers what life in Far Far Away land would have been like had he never existed in this final chapter of the popular animated film series. There used to be a time when the villagers would run in terror at the mere mention of the name Shrek, but these days the big green ogre is married to Princess Fiona and raising triplets. Maintaining your fierce public persona is no simple task when you're juggling infants and changing diapers, so when Shrek realizes that nobody is afraid of him anymore he recruits mischief-maker Rumpelstiltskin to restore his once-mighty roar. Unfortunately for Shrek, that plan hits an unexpected hitch. As a result, the morose monster takes a trip into an alternate-universe Far Far Away land where there is no Shrek, and Rumpelstiltskin reigns. There, Donkey spends his days hauling carts, and a portly Puss in Boots prefers lounging to swashbuckling. Perhaps with a little extra effort, Shrek will be able to regain his status as top ogre in town and still have his happily ever after, too. - Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide (Source)","['Shrek', 'Forever', 'After', 'Official', 'Trailer', 'New']",53282,273,12,23,10192,0.46202090592334494

Film Description: A mysterious criminal mastermind has stolen one of the pyramids in Egypt, sparking a fit of jealous envy in evil genius Gru (Steve Carell), who hasn't managed to make headlines since he and his minions swiped the Times Square JumboTron years back. Ever since Gru was a little boy, he dreamed of going to the moon. Now, if Gru can just build a rocket and get his hands on a powerful shrink-ray, he can cement his reputation as the greatest thief who ever lived by stealing the Earth's satellite right out of the sky. But immediately after Gru heists the shrink-ray, the cunning super-nerd Vector (Jason Segel) swoops in and snatches it right out of his hands. Now, in order to claim the moon, Gru must first reacquire the weapon from Vector. Armed with the knowledge that his nemesis has a mean sweet tooth, Gru adopts cookie-selling orphans Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Agnes (Elsie Fisher), and Edith (Dana Gaier) and commissions a new line of cookie robots from the evil Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), his personal weapons specialist. But as Gru and his diminutive yellow minions prepare to carry out the biggest heist in history, something strange happens. Gru discovers that the three little girls who have come into his life are much more than simple pawns. They actually seem to care about Gru, and it turns out the scheming evildoer makes a pretty good father. When Gru realizes that his upcoming moon mission clashes with a ballet performance by the girls, he must decide what's more important -- being a present parent or cementing his nefarious reputation once and for all.","['despicable me', 'despicable me trailer', 'despicable me part 1', 'despicable me song', 'steve carell', 'jack mcbrayer', 'mindy kaling', 'davis desmond', 'chris renaud', 'pierre coffin', 'toy videos', 'children family', 'family animation', 'family comedies', 'christopher meledandri', 'janet healy', 'robert taylor', 'john cohen', 'nina rappaport', 'sergio pablos', 'discovery videos', 'humor videos', 'desert videos', 'egypt videos', 'justin', 'gru', 'movie clips', 'movieclipsdotcom', '#AMG:V+++475296', '/m/04t2l2', '/m/0h3mrc', '/m/0h27vc']",17808920,19360,5228,1,20352,0.3500821018062397

Entertainment,UCgKkNPU2Ib7_TcyAl8M2S-w,"Acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan directs an international cast in this sci-fi actioner that travels around the globe and into the world of dreams. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the best there is at extraction: stealing valuable secrets inside the subconscious during the mind's vulnerable dream state. His skill has made him a coveted player in industrial espionage but also has made him a fugitive and cost him dearly. Now he may get a second chance if he can do the impossible: inception, planting an idea rather than stealing one. If they succeed, Cobb and his team could pull off the perfect crime. But no planning or expertise can prepare them for a dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy only Cobb could have seen coming. Available on Blu-ray & DVD 12/7!

30 years later, the five friends have since separated. Lenny Feder (Adam Sandler) is a high powered Hollywood talent agent who is married to Roxanne (Salma Hayek), a fashion designer. Together, they have two sons, Greg and Keith, and one daughter Becky, all of whom have become spoiled, much to Lenny's annoyance. Eric Lamonsoff (Kevin James) is now a co-owner of a lawn furniture company (but he says he is just to impress his friends) who is married to Sally (Maria Bello). Together, they have one daughter, Donna and one son Bean, who still breastfeeds despite being four years old, much to Eric's chagrin. Kurt McKenzie (Chris Rock) is a stay at home father who is married to Deanne (Maya Rudolph), the primary breadwinner of the family. Together, they have a son, Andre, and a daughter, Charlotte, while Deanne is pregnant with a third child, and her mother, Ronzoni, lives with them as well. All of them harass Kurt for not being more useful. Rob Hilliard (Rob Schneider) is a thrice divorced pacifist vegan married to Gloria (Joyce Van Patten), who is 30 years older than him. Marcus Higgins (David Spade) has become a single womanizer.","['Grown', 'Ups', 'Trailer', '(2010)', 'trailer', 'sneak peek', 'film', 'movie trailer']",484441,376,18,36,38365,0.3398406374501992

In Columbia Pictures' The Karate Kid, 12-year-old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) could've been the most popular kid in Detroit, but his mother's (Taraji P. Henson) latest career move has landed him in China. Dre immediately falls for his classmate Mei Ying - and the feeling is mutual - but cultural differences make such a friendship impossible. Even worse, Dre's feelings make an enemy of the class bully, Cheng. In the land of kung fu, Dre knows only a little karate, and Cheng puts ""the karate kid"" on the floor with ease. With no friends in a strange land, Dre has nowhere to turn but maintenance man Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), who is secretly a master of kung fu. As Han teaches Dre that kung fu is not about punches and parries, but maturity and calm, Dre realizes that facing down the bullies will be the fight of his life.

Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren),Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) -- with newest members Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) and Maggie (Yu Nan) aboard -- are reunited when Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) enlists the Expendables to take on a seemingly simple job. The task looks like an easy paycheck for Barney and his band of old-school mercenaries. But when things go wrong and one of their own is viciously killed, the Expendables are compelled to seek revenge in hostile territory where the odds are stacked against them. Hell-bent on payback, the crew cuts a swath of destruction through opposing forces, wreaking havoc and shutting down an unexpected threat in the nick of time — six tons of weapons-grade plutonium; enough to change the balance of power in the world. But that's nothing compared to the justice they serve against the villainous adversary who savagely murdered their brother. 

That is done the Expendables way....

In THE EXPENDABLES 3, Barney (Stallone), Christmas (Statham) and the rest of the team comes face-to-face with Conrad Stonebanks (Gibson), who years ago co-founded The Expendables with Barney. Stonebanks subsequently became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to kill... or so he thought. In order to defeat Stonebanks, Barney decides that he has to fight old blood with new blood, and brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy. The latest mission becomes a clash of classic old-school style versus high-tech expertise in the Expendables' most personal battle yet.

Scott Pilgrim has never had a problem getting a girlfriend.  It's getting rid of them that proves difficult.  From the girl who kicked his heart's ass—and now is back in town—to the teenage distraction he's trying to shake when Ramona rollerblades into his world, love hasn't been easy.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
From visionary director David Fincher (Fight Club, Seven) comes the story of the founding of massive social website, Facebook. Adapted from Ben Mezrich's 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires, the film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Director David Fincher (Fight Club, Seven) teams with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing) to explore the meaning of success in the early 21st century from the perspectives of the technological innovators who revolutionized the way we all communicate. The year was 2003. As prohibitively expensive technology became affordable to the masses and the Internet made it easy to stay in touch with people who were halfway across the world, Harvard undergrad and computer programming wizard Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) launched a website with the potential to alter the very fabric of our society. At the time, Zuckerberg was just six years away from making his first million. But his hearty payday would come at a high price, because despite all of Zuckerberg's wealth and success, his personal life began to suffer as he became mired in legal disputes, and discovered that many of the 500 million people he had friended during his rise to the top were eager to see him fall. Chief among that growing list of detractors was Zuckerberg's former college friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), whose generous financial contributions to Facebook served as the seed that helped the company to sprout. And some might argue that Zuckerberg's bold venture wouldn't have evolved into the cultural juggernaut that it ultimately became had Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) not spread the word about Facebook to the venture capitalists from Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) engage Zuckerberg in a fierce courtroom battle for ownership of Facebook that left many suspecting the young entrepreneur might have let his greed eclipse his better judgment. The Social Network was based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich.

uaaC57tcci0,The Social Dilemma | Official Trailer | Netflix,Netflix,UCWOA1ZGywLbqmigxE4Qlvuw,"We tweet, we like, and we share— but what are the consequences of our growing dependence on social media? As digital platforms increasingly become a lifeline to stay connected, Silicon Valley insiders reveal how social media is reprogramming civilization by exposing what’s hiding on the other side of your screen.

https://Netflix.com/thesocialdilemma

ABOUT THE SOCIAL DILEMMA

The world has long recognized the positive applications of social media, from its role in empowering protesters to speak out against oppression during the Arab Spring uprisings almost a decade ago, to serving an instrumental role in fighting for equity and justice today. And in 2020, during an astonishing global pandemic, social media has become our lifeline to stay in touch with loved ones, as well as proving to be an asset for mobilizing civil rights protests. However, the system that connects us also invisibly controls us. The collective lack of understanding about how these platforms actually operate has led to hidden and often harmful consequences to society—consequences that are becoming more and more evident over time, and consequences that, the subjects in The Social Dilemma suggest, are an existential threat to humanity.

The Social Dilemma is a powerful exploration of the disproportionate impact that a relatively small number of engineers in Silicon Valley have over the way we think, act, and live our lives. The film deftly tackles an underlying cause of our viral conspiracy theories, teenage mental health issues, rampant misinformation and political polarization, and makes these issues visceral, understandable, and urgent. Through a unique combination of documentary investigation and entertaining narrative drama, award-winning filmmakers Jeff Orlowski (Chasing Ice, Chasing Coral) and Larissa Rhodes (Chasing Coral) have once again exposed the invisible in a manner that is both enlightening and harrowing as they disrupt the disrupters by unveiling the hidden machinations behind everyone’s favorite social media and search platforms. 

The film features compelling interviews with high-profile tech whistleblowers and innovation leaders including Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology; the co-inventor of the Facebook “Like” button, Justin Rosenstein; Tim Kendall, former President of Pinterest and former Director of Monetization at Facebook; Cathy O’Neil, author of Weapons of Math Destruction; Rashida Richardson, Director of Policy at the AI Now Institute, and many others. Demonstrating how social media affects consumers on a personal level, these fascinating insider insights are seamlessly woven into a captivating narrative, including Vincent Kartheiser (Mad Men), that illuminates the very real consequences these seemingly innocent technologies can have on our everyday lives.

Από το σκηνοθέτη Ντέιβιντ Φίντσερ και το σεναριογράφο Άαρον Σόρκιν, έρχεται το ""The Social Network"", μια ταινία που αποδεικνύει ότι δεν μπορείς να κάνεις 500 εκατομμύρια φίλους, χωρίς να κάνεις και μερικούς εχθρούς. 

Μια φθινοπωρινή βραδιά του 2003, ο φοιτητής του Χάρβαρντ και ιδιοφυΐα στις γλώσσες προγραμματισμού, Μαρκ Ζούκερμπεργκ, κάθεται στον υπολογιστή του και ξεκινά να δουλεύει πάνω σε μια καινούρια ιδέα. Σε μια έξαψη blogging και προγραμματισμού στο φοιτητικό του δωμάτιο, ο Μαρκ αρχίζει κάτι που σύντομα θα μετατραπεί σε ένα παγκόσμιο κοινωνικό δίκτυο και θα προκαλέσει επανάσταση στην επικοινωνία. Μόλις έξι χρόνια, αλλά και 500 εκατομμύρια φίλους μετά, ο Μαρκ Ζούκερμπεργκ γίνεται ο νεαρότερος δισεκατομμυριούχος στην Ιστορία... Όμως για αυτόν τον επιχειρηματία, η επιτυχία οδηγεί τόσο σε προσωπικές όσο και νομικές επιπλοκές.

Η ταινία είναι σε παραγωγή Σκοτ Ρούντιν, Ντέινα Μπρουνέτι, Μάικλ ΝτεΛούκα και Σεάν Σαφίν και βασισμένη στο βιβλίο ""The Accidental Billionaires"" του Μπεν Μέζρικ.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
From the director of Gone Baby Gone, comes a crime film set in the streets of Boston, where four bank robbers including Doug (Ben Affleck) and James (Jeremy Renner) are chased by an FBI agent (Jon Hamm). To complicate matters, Doug falls in love with the woman (Rebecca Hall) he took as a hostage.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Boston bank robber Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) falls for a woman his gang had previously taken hostage after feigning a chance meeting with her to ensure that she can't identify them in Affleck's adaptation of author Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves. The son of a tough Charlestown, MA thief, Doug passed on his chance to walk the straight and narrow in favor of becoming a career bank robber. Not only is Doug's crew one of the most ruthless in Boston, but they're also one of the best; they never leave a trace of evidence, and always make a clean break. Over the years, Doug's fearless partners in crime have become something of a surrogate family to him; Jem (Jeremy Renner), the most dangerous of the bunch, is the closest thing Doug has ever had to a brother. But a divide begins to open between the two career criminals when Jem takes bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage during a particularly tense heist, and the group subsequently discovers that she hails from their own tight-knit suburb. When Jem proposes that the gang make an effort to find out just how much Claire recalls about the crime, Doug fears that his volatile partner may do more harm than good and volunteers himself for the job. Later, Doug turns on the charm while pretending to bump into Claire by chance, and becomes convinced that she doesn't suspect him of being the same man who just robbed her bank. As the feds turn up the heat on the gang, Doug finds himself falling for Claire, and searching desperately for a means of cutting his ties to his criminal past. But with each passing day, Jem grows increasingly suspicious of Doug's true motivations. Now caught between two worlds with no chance of turning back, Doug realizes that his only hope for finding a happy future is to betray the only family he's ever known.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Emma Stone stars as Olive, a clean-cut high school virgin, whose life begins to parallel Hester Prynne's in ""The Scarlett Letter,"" After a little white lie about losing her virginity gets out, Olive finds herself the victim of the rumor mill, which she twists around for her own social advancement.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter is re-imagined as a contemporary high school comedy in this tale of a scheming student who plots to give her popularity a boost by painting herself the easiest lay in school. Like most high school kids, Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) just wants to be popular. So much so than when her best friend, Rhiannon (Aly Michalka), asks Olive how her weekend went, the bored teen decides to whip up a spicy white lie just to make things interesting. But that minor exaggeration begins to take on a life of its own when it reaches the ears of motor-mouth gossip Jesus freak Marianne (Amanda Bynes), and in no time the entire student body is abuzz over unassuming Olive's unrepentant weekend of debauchery. Of course not a word of it is true, but that doesn't stop everyone in school from talking, and an amused Olive from deciding to go with the flow. Playing the role of the hussy to the hilt, the girl who used to be invisible begins dressing provocatively and turning heads in the hallways. The students aren't the only ones taking notice, either; Olive's English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church), is concerned that the kind of attention she's receiving isn't healthy for a developing girl, and his wife (Lisa Kudrow), the school guidance counselor, is in full agreement. The only people who seem remotely interested in the truth are Olive's trusting and open-minded parents (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson). As Olive takes note of the parallels between her own situation and the plight of the Scarlet Letter heroine Hester Prynne, she realizes that she may be able to manipulate her newfound notoriety to give fellow classmate Brandon's (Dan Byrd) popularity a much-needed shot in the arm. Olive never thought her little game could possibly have any negative effect on anyone but herself, but when loose lips start sinking ships all around her, she realizes that it's high time for the truth to come out.

Partially inspired by the novel The Scarlet Letter, the film was shot at Screen Gems studios and in Ojai, California. Screen Gems distributes with an expected release on September 17, 2010

Plot

Clean-cut high-schooler Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) agrees to pretend that she lost her virginity to her gay friend, Brandon (Dan Byrd). Several boys learn what she has done and beg her to perform the same service for them, hoping to gain some of her newfound fame. This eventually turns into a full-fledged business, lucrative and socially beneficial for Olive, enough so to gain the ire of her rival, Marianne (Amanda Bynes), who doesn't like the attention she's getting. Marianne therefore starts a string of rumors in order to bring down Olive's reputation and force her to leave the school. Olive's life begins to resemble that of Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter. Olive then decides to use the rumors to her own advantage, affixing a red A to her clothing in reference to the embattled heroine of the novel.

In Theaters August
https://www.goodboysmovie.com/

Just how bad can one day get? The creative minds behind Superbad, Pineapple Express and Sausage Party take on sixth grade hard in the outrageous comedy, Good Boys. 

After being invited to his first kissing party, 12-year-old Max (Room’s Jacob Tremblay) is panicking because he doesn’t know how to kiss. Eager for some pointers, Max and his best friends Thor (Brady Noon, HBO’s Boardwalk Empire) and Lucas (Keith L. Williams, Fox’s The Last Man On Earth) decide to use Max’s dad’s drone – which Max is forbidden to touch – to spy (they think) on a teenage couple making out next door. 

But when things go ridiculously wrong, the drone is destroyed. Desperate to replace it before Max’s dad (Will Forte, The Last Man on Earth) gets home, the boys skip school and set off on an odyssey of epically bad decisions involving some accidentally stolen drugs, frat-house paintball, and running from both the cops and terrifying teenage girls (Life of the Party’s Molly Gordon and Ocean’s Eight’s Midori Francis). 

From Point Grey producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the writers of Superbad, Pineapple Express and Sausage Party, and James Weaver (Neighbors), Good Boys, from Universal Pictures and Good Universe, is written by the team of Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky (NBC’s The Office, Bad Teacher). Eisenberg also produces and Stupnitsky directs.","['Good boys', 'good boys red band trailer', 'good boys trailer', 'red band trailer', 'good boys red band', 'red band', 'good boys movie', 'seth rogen', 'seth rogen trailer', 'seth rogen movie', 'jacob tremblay', 'keith Williams', 'brady noon', 'good boys restricted trailer', 'restricted trailer', 'nsfw trailer', 'nsfw']",3082171,29913,2046,2474,39514,0.29615384615384616

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Aron (James Franco) falls, discovering to his horror that he is stuck.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
James Franco stars in director Danny Boyle's inspiring survival drama based on the incredible true story of Aron Ralston, who became trapped alone in a Utah canyon for days after slipping on a loose rock, and resorted to extraordinary measures in order to make it out of his dire predicament alive. An experienced hiker and climber, Ralston (Franco) is very much in his element when he parks his truck by a mountain near Moab, UT, hops on his bike, and peddles to the middle of nowhere. Later, when Ralston encounters a pair of young female hikers who have gotten lost while searching for a local landmark, he jovially shows them a sight that most casual hikers miss before bidding them farewell and continuing on his way. Drifting through the canyons alone, deep in thought, however, the explorer who presumed he was ready for anything quickly discovers just how fast things can spin out of control when a rock gives way as he shimmies down a crevice, and pins his hand to the unforgiving wall of stone. Over the course of the next 127 hours, Ralston tries everything he can think of to free himself, flashing back to small but memorable events in his life -- as well as forward to the future that he might enjoy should he manage to wiggle free -- as his body begins the slow process of shutting down. Eventually realizing that the only way out is to leave part of himself behind, the exhausted, delirious adventurer draws his cheap made-in-China multi-tool, and does what it takes to survive.

Megamind decides that the only way out of his rut is to create a new hero opponent called ""Titan,"" who promises to be bigger, better and stronger than Metro Man ever was. Pretty quickly Titan starts to think it's much more fun to be a villain than a good guy . Except Titan doesn't just want to rule the world, he wants to destroy it. Now, Megamind must decide: can he defeat his own diabolical creation? Can the world's smartest man make the smart decision for once? Can the evil genius become the unlikely hero of his own story?

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final adventure in the Harry Potter film series, is a much-anticipated motion picture event to be told in two full-length parts. Part 1 begins as Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort's immortality and destruction--the Horcruxes. On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart. Meanwhile, the wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort...alive. Harry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale--the legend of the Deathly Hallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks. Little does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became ""the Boy Who Lived."" No longer just a boy, Harry Potter is drawing ever closer to the task for which he has been preparing since the day he first stepped into Hogwarts: the ultimate battle with Voldemort.","['harry potter trailer', 'HP7', 'harry potter new trailer', 'Daniel Radcliffe', 'Rupert Grint', 'Emma Watson', 'Helena Bonham Carter', 'Robbie Coltrane', 'Tom Felton', 'Ralph Fiennes', 'Brendan Gleeson', 'Richard Griffiths', 'John Hurt', 'Jason Isaacs', 'Helen McCrory']",1502240,7543,95,1573,12444,0.4190720258969517

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I hits theaters on November 19th, 2010.

Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felton, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy, Jamie Campbell Bower, Bonnie Wright, Helena Bonham Carter, Timothy Spall, Michael Gambon, Rhys Ifans, Maggie Smith, John Hurt, Jason Isaacs, Ciaran Hind

Part 1 begins as Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort's immortality and destruction-the Horcruxes. On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart.

Meanwhile, the wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort... alive.

Harry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale-the legend of the Deathly Hallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks.

Little does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became ""the Boy Who Lived."" No longer just a boy, Harry Potter is drawing ever closer to the task for which he has been preparing since the day he first stepped into Hogwarts: the ultimate battle with Voldemort.

Als Sohn des britischen Königs George V. gehört es zu den Pflichten von Bertie (Colin Firth), wie der Duke of York von seiner Familie genannt wird, öffentlich zu sprechen. Für den zurückhaltend-besonnenen Mann eine Qual, denn seit seiner Jugend leidet er an einem schweren Stottern. Kein Arzt und kein Psychologe kann ihm helfen, weshalb sich Berties liebevoll sorgende Ehefrau Königin Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) an den exzentrischen Sprachtherapeuten Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) wendet.

Mit seinem forschen Auftreten und den unkonventionellen Behandlungsmethoden stößt er seinen adligen Patienten zunächst vor den Kopf. Bald aber zeigen sich erste Erfolge. Nach dem Tod seines Vaters und der Abdankung seines Bruders Edward VIII. (Guy Pearce) wegen dessen Liebe zur geschiedenen Bürgerlichen Wallis Simpson wird Bertie unter dem Namen George VI. 1936 unerwartet zu Englands neuem König. 

Öffentliche Auftritte und Radioansprachen lassen sich fortan noch weniger umgehen als zuvor, und nicht zuletzt der drohende Krieg erhöht den Druck auf den schüchternen Regenten. Die Zusammenarbeit und wachsende Freundschaft mit Logue hilft Bertie dabei erheblich. Doch kurz vor der offiziellen Krönung stellt eine unerwartete Enthüllung das gegenseitige Vertrauen und damit auch Berties Kampf gegen das Stottern auf die Probe.

Flynn's curious captor, who's looking for her ticket out of the tower where she's been locked away for years, strikes a deal with the handsome thief and the unlikely duo set off on an action-packed escapade, complete with a super-cop horse, an over-protective chameleon and a gruff gang of pub thugs.

NOW PLAYING EVERYWHERE

Dicky Ecklund (CHRISTIAN BALE) is a former boxing legend that squandered his talents and threw away his shot at greatness.

Micky Ward (MARK WAHLBERG), his half brother, is the struggling journeyman boxer
who spent his life living in his big brother's shadow.   

The Fighter is the inspirational, true story of these two brothers who, against all the odds,
come together to train for a historic title bout that will unite their fractured family, redeem
their pasts and, at last, give their hard-luck town what it's been waiting for: pride.  The story
unfolds on the gritty, blue-collar streets of Lowell, Mass, where Dicky was once known as
""The Pride of Lowell"" having gone the distance with the world champion Sugar Ray Leonard.
However, after losing that fight, like the town of Lowell, Dicky's fallen on hard times.  His
boxing days are behind him and his life has become shattered by drug abuse.   

Younger brother Micky, meanwhile, has become the family's fighter and fading hope for a
champion.  But despite all of his work, Micky's career is failing and he loses fight after
punishing fight.  Dicky and Micky's tougher-than-nails mother, Alice (MELISSA LEO),
manages his career and Dicky serves as his highly unreliable trainer.  When Micky's latest
fight nearly kills him, it looks like it could all be over -- until his iron-willed new girlfriend,
Charlene (AMY ADAMS), convinces him to do the unthinkable:  split with his family, pursue
his own interests and train without his increasingly volatile and criminal brother.  

Now Micky has the chance of a lifetime as he earns a shot at the World Championship.
But when his brother and dysfunctional family reenter his life, they must all reconcile their
pasts and become more than just a family in name.  With Micky and Dicky reunited, this
becomes more than just a fight -- it's an all-out comeback for these brothers, their family, and
their city.  When it's over, Micky will have become a World Champion, a Hall of Fame
legend, and the new ""Pride of Lowell"". 

The Fighter is a moving and often humorous drama about fighting for the people you love.","['trailer', 'film', 'alliance', 'drama', 'movie', 'mark', 'whalberg']",882735,2946,88,149,45317,0.3031400966183575

Micky Ward und Dicky Eklund. Zwei Brüder. Zwei Boxer. Dicky, der ältere der beiden, hat seine besten Zeiten längst hinter sich. Inzwischen ist er nur noch ein abgehalfterter Crack-Junkie. Auch Micky ist der große Durchbruch als Boxer bislang verwehrt geblieben. Sein Bruder wird als Trainer auf Grund der Drogensucht immer unzuverlässiger, und seine Mutter Alice macht ihren Job als Managerin mehr schlecht als recht. Micky muss als Aufbaugegner für schwerere Gegner herhalten und verliert Kampf auf Kampf. Als nach einer weiteren Niederlage sein Bruder auch noch im Gefängnis landet, beschließt Micky, die Boxhandschuhe an den Nagel zu hängen. Doch seine Freundin Charlene überzeugt ihn davon, dass er ohne die zweifelhafte Unterstützung seiner Familie bessere Chancen als Profiboxer hätte. Mit neuem Trainer und neuem Management macht Micky sich an die Vorbereitung auf einen weiteren Kampf – und gewinnt.

Inspirada en una increíble historia real, nos llega la áspera pero cariñosamente humorística historia del regreso de un héroe del boxeo poco común: Micky Ward ""El Irlandés"" (MARK WAHLBERG) y de su hermanastro, Dicky Eklund (CHRISTIAN BALE), quienes tuvieron que enfrentarse como contrincantes antes de unirse como hermanos en una dura pelea para ganar un importante campeonato y fortalecer sus lazos familiares. 
Con años de preparación, The Fighter fue filmada en tan sólo 33 días en las calles de los barrios obreros de Lowell, Massachusetts.  Al comienzo, los productores David Hoberman y Todd Lieberman se enamoraron de la historia de Micky y Dicky y vieron que se trataba de mucho más que de una victoria deportiva.  La estrella y productor Mark Wahlberg, el director David O. Russell, un reparto y un equipo muy unido, se juntaron para hacer que la familia de Micky y de Dicky profundamente humana cobre vida a través de una serie de momentos alternativamente cómicos, tiernos, dolorosos y triunfantes que se desarrollan tanto en la sala de estar como en el ring de boxeo.
La historia comienza cuando Dicky, orgullo de la ciudad que una vez peleó ferozmente contra Sugar Ray Leonard, se enfrenta a tiempos difíciles.  Mientras tanto, Micky se ha convertido en el luchador de la familia, con su incipiente carrera en manos de su madre Alice (MELISSA LEO).  Sin embargo, a pesar de su gran gancho izquierdo, siempre lo castigan en el ring. Cuando la más reciente lucha de Micky casi lo mata, es persuadido por la voluntad de hierro de su nueva novia, Charlene (AMY ADAMS), de hacer lo impensable: separarse de su familia, perseguir sus propios intereses y entrenar lejos de su problemático hermano.  
  Entonces, se le presenta a Micky la oportunidad de su vida en una pelea por el título, pero pronto queda claro que hará falta la fortaleza de su hermano y de toda la familia para que llegue allí. Desafiando a los detractores, apuesta por una decisión que traerá nuevamente a Dicky, Charlene, Alice y toda la familia Ward/ Eklund a su esquina del ring y dará como resultado una de la cadenas de victorias más sorprendentes de este deporte.  De la nada, Micky se convertirá en un campeón, conocido como un luchador resistente y leal que peleó la batalla más difícil de todos, por su familia.","['THE FIGTHER', 'Tripictures', 'MARK WAHLBERG', 'CHRISTIAN BALE', 'MELISSA LEO', 'AMY ADAMS', 'David O.

Seventeen year old Kyle (Alex Pettyfer) is the spoiled, shallow and incredibly  popular prince of his high school kingdom.   Entirely captivated  and empowered by his own physical  appearance, Kyle foolishly chooses Kendra (Mary-Kate Olsen) as  his latest target for humiliation.  But things are not as they seem and the disgraced Kendra, a witch masquerading as a high school student, enacts the perfect revenge.  She transforms Kyle into someone as unattractive on the outside as he is on the inside.  Now he has one year to find someone to love him, or he will remain ""Beastly"" forever.  To break the spell, Kyle must  discover a beauty who can see past the surface.  His only hope, a quiet classmate he never noticed named Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens), may be his best chance to prove that love is never ugly.","['alliance', 'movie', 'trailer', 'film', 'romance', 'teen', 'horror', 'thriller', 'message', 'twilight', 'star', 'crossed', 'lovers', 'beastly']",812856,3210,107,492,38117,0.34847161572052404

But she meets her match in Jamie (Jake Gyllenhaal), whose relentless and nearly infallible charm serve him well with women and in the cutthroat world of pharmaceutical sales. Maggie and Jamie's evolving relationship takes them both by surprise, as they find themselves under the influence of the ultimate drug: love.   Most relationships proceed from love to sex. This one goes the opposite direction and thus makes an unexpected film from an unconventional love story.

Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway previously left jaws dropped with approving disbelief in the adult movie ""Brokeback Mountain."" Years later, after both leaped from one box-office hit to another, Gyllenhaal and Hathaway reunite in the upcoming romantic comedy ""Love And Other Drugs"" for a slap of the awe-stunning realities in adult relationships.
Directed by Edward Zwick and based on Jamie Reidy's humorous memoir ""Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman,"" the movie tells the story of Reidy's stint as Pfizer salesman in the 1990s. As a salesman for Pfizer and considered to be the Jerry Maguire of the prescriptive drug world, Reidy (played by Gyllenhaal) gets involved with Maggie (Hathaway) who won't let anything or anyone tie her down.
Romancing each other within the political and social context of medical breakthroughs, Jamie and Maggie's evolving relationship takes them both by surprise as they find themselves under the influence of the ultimate drug: love.","['Movies', 'Official Trailer', 'Jake Gyllenhall', 'Anne Hathaway', 'Romantic Comedy', 'entertainment', 'teaser trailer', 'trailers', 'official', 'hollywood actor']",86227,181,18,0,43347,0.5130568356374807

Lucy and Edmond are spending a dreary holiday with their cousin Eustace Clarence Scrub, who is a rather dour and mean spirited little boy. They are unexpectedly drawn into Narnia when a painting of a ship on the wall of Lucy's room comes to life, and the three children fall into the ocean to be rescued be the Dawn Treader.

Once safely on board, Lucy and Edmond are greeted by their friend Caspian (now King Caspian) who has undertaken a quest to find the seven lost Lords of Narnia, as he had previously promised to Aslan. Lucy and Edmond are delighted to be back in Narnia, but Eustace is less than enthusiastic. Reepicheep is also on board, as he has vowed to find the seas of the 'utter east'.

Oggi, a distanza di quasi sei anni, molte cose sono cambiate: Salle ha lasciato il posto al tedesco Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck e si è proposto come sceneggiatore. Il ruolo dell'agente è stato invece assegnato ad Angelina Jolie, dopo che per mesi era stata data per certa la presenza di Charlize Theron. Simile trafila ha riguardato anche la scelta dell'interprete maschile: Tom Cruise, inizialmente individuato come protagonista, è stato prima sostituito con Sam Avatar Worthington e poi - per ragioni artistiche, come si legge su ogni comunicato - da Johnny Depp.","['the', 'tourist', 'official', 'trailer', 'film', 'movie', 'preview', 'footage', 'florian', 'henckel', 'von', 'donnersmarck', 'johnny', 'depp', 'angelina', 'jolie', 'paul', 'bettany', 'thriller', 'drama']",71513,11,0,4,37710,0.41691616766467066

FILM DESCRIPTION:
A birthday party for the twins gives Greg an opportunity to redeem himself after he takes a job that raises the suspicions of his overbearing father-in-law, Jack (Robert De Niro), in this installment of the hit comedy series. Greg (Ben Stiller) and Pam (Teri Polo) have been together for ten years, and now they're the proud parents of two adorable twins. But money is tight, and in order to keep his family afloat, devoted nurse Greg takes a second job working for a drug company. But that development doesn't sit well with Jack, whose previous suspicions regarding his hapless son-in-law soon come back in full force after learning of this development. With the twins' birthday fast approaching, the proud parents invite the entire clan over to celebrate in style, including Kevin (Owen Wilson), who still carries a torch for his pretty ex Pam. As the festivities get under way, Greg takes every opportunity available to prove to Jack that he's fully capable of providing for his family. Now Greg has one last chance to prove that he's trustworthy. Should he fail, the circle of trust will be broken for good. Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Laura Dern, and Jessica Alba co-star.

Despite having kids of his own, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is still under the watchful eye of his father-in-law (Robert De Niro).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
A birthday party for the twins gives Greg an opportunity to redeem himself after he takes a job that raises the suspicions of his overbearing father-in-law, Jack (Robert De Niro), in this installment of the hit comedy series. Greg (Ben Stiller) and Pam (Teri Polo) have been together for ten years, and now they're the proud parents of two adorable twins. But money is tight, and in order to keep his family afloat, devoted nurse Greg takes a second job working for a drug company. But that development doesn't sit well with Jack, whose previous suspicions regarding his hapless son-in-law soon come back in full force after learning of this development. With the twins' birthday fast approaching, the proud parents invite the entire clan over to celebrate in style, including Kevin (Owen Wilson), who still carries a torch for his pretty ex Pam. As the festivities get under way, Greg takes every opportunity available to prove to Jack that he's fully capable of providing for his family. Now Greg has one last chance to prove that he's trustworthy. Should he fail, the circle of trust will be broken for good. Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Laura Dern, and Jessica Alba co-star.

PMA-taGtfXs,Watch the Official The Green Hornet Trailer in HD,Sony Pictures Entertainment,UCz97F7dMxBNOfGYu3rx8aCw,"Release Date: 14 January 2011 (United States)
Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) is a slacker by day, party animal by night... until he finds a serious career that's seriously cool: crime-fighting action hero. As the Green Hornet, he teams up with gadget wiz and martial arts master Kato (Jay Chou) to take down LA's underworld. Even Britt's assistant Lenore (Cameron Diaz) doesn't suspect this mismatched pair is the masked duo busting the city's toughest thugs led by Chudnofsky (Academy Award® winner Christoph Waltz, 2010, Supporting Actor, Inglourious Basterds). With style, swagger and an arsenal of awesome gear, the Green Hornet and Kato are doing justice their way, making every mission a mix of over-the-top action and outrageous comedy.

Genre: Action / Comedy / Crime
Cast: Cameron Diaz, Edward James Olmos, Tom Wilkinson, Seth Rogen, Jay Chou, David Harbour, Christoph Waltz

Billionaire bad boy Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) decides to become a superhero known to villians as The Green Hornet. Based on the comic book.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In the 3D action-comedy The Green Hornet, Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) is the son of LA's most prominent and respected media magnate and perfectly happy to maintain a directionless existence on the party scene - until his father (Tom Wilkinson) mysteriously dies, leaving Britt his vast media empire. Striking an unlikely friendship with one of his father's more industrious and inventive employees, Kato (Jay Chou), they see their chance to do something meaningful for the first time in their lives: fight crime. To get close to the criminals, they come up with the perfect cover: they'll pose as criminals themselves. Protecting the law by breaking it, Britt becomes the vigilante The Green Hornet as he and Kato hit the streets. Using all his ingenuity and skill, Kato builds the ultimate in advanced retro weaponry, Black Beauty, an indestructible car equal parts firepower and horsepower. Rolling in a mobile fortress on wheels and striking the bad guys with Kato's clever gadgets, The Green Hornet and Kato quickly start making a name for themselves, and with the help of Britt's new secretary, Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz), they begin hunting down the man who controls LA's gritty underworld: Benjamin Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz). But Chudnofsky has plans of his own: to swat down The Green Hornet once and for all. -

A mysterious stranger (Daniel Craig) and a hard-boiled Colonel (Harrison Ford) become reluctant allies when aliens invade the Old West.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
1875. New Mexico Territory. A stranger (Craig) with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford). It's a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been, he realizes he holds a secret that could give the town a fighting chance against the alien force. -

Blockbuster filmmaker Jon Favreau directs Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford in an event film for summer 2011 that crosses the classic Western with the alien-invasion movie in a blazingly original way: Cowboys & Aliens.  Joined by an arsenal of top moviemakers—Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci—he brings an all-new action thriller that will take audiences into the Old West, where a lone cowboy leads an uprising against a terror from beyond our world.

1875.  New Mexico Territory.  A stranger (Craig) with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution.  The only hint to his history is a mysterious shackle that encircles one wrist.  What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford).  It's a town that lives in fear.

But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky.  Screaming down with breathtaking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the helpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever known.

Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation.  As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been, he realizes he holds a secret that could give the town a fighting chance against the alien force.  With the help of the elusive traveler Ella (Olivia Wilde), he pulls together a posse comprised of former opponents—townsfolk, Dolarhyde and his boys, outlaws and Apache warriors—all in danger of annihilation.  United against a common enemy, they will prepare for an epic showdown for survival.  

The screenplay for Cowboys & Aliens is by Roberto Orci & Alex Kurtzman & Damon Lindelof and Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby, from a screen story by Fergus & Ostby and Steve Oedekerk.  It is based on Platinum Studios' ""Cowboys & Aliens"" by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg.  ...","['Cowboys Aliens', 'Cowboys Aliens movie', 'Cowboys and Aliens', 'Jon Favreau', 'Daniel Craig', 'Harrison Ford', 'Olivia Wilde', 'Sam Rockwell', 'cowboys', 'aliens', 'official trailer', 'Iron Man', 'Summer 2011 movies']",230401,801,33,161,49849,0.43577023498694517

1873. Die Wüste von Arizona. Ein Mann ohne Namen und Gedächtnis (Daniel Craig) taucht in dem kleinen Städtchen Absolution auf. Eine eigenartige Metallmanschette an seinem linken Unterarm macht ihn für alle Einwohner der kleinen Wüstenstadt zu einem mysteriösen Fremden, dem sie nicht trauen wollen.

Eindringlinge sind in der Stadt nicht willkommen, denn die Bürger haben Angst, jede noch so kleine, falsche Bewegung könnte den Zorn des drakonischen Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) wecken, der die Gemeinde mit eiserner Faust regiert. Doch als die Stadt ohne Vorwarnung von Außerirdischen attackiert wird, werden die Karten neu gemischt.

Der Fremde, mittlerweile bekannt als Jake Lonergan, ist die letzte Hoffnung: Denn er trägt ein Geheimnis mit sich, mit dem man den übermächtigen Aliens die Stirn bieten kann. Mit Hilfe der undurchschaubaren Reisenden Ella (Olivia Wilde) treibt er eine Gruppe mutiger Outlaws zusammen, die bereit sind, den außerirdischen Angreifern in einem noch nie dagewesenen Kampf erbitterten Widerstand zu leisten ...

""Cowboys & Aliens"" verbindet die Coolness von James Bond 007 mit den actionreichen Abenteuern von Indiana Jones! Unter der Regie von ""Iron-Man""-Macher Jon Favreau überzeugen Daniel Craig (""Unbeugsam"") und Harrison Ford (""Ausnamesituation"", ""Morning Glory"") in einer unglaublichen Mischung aus Science-Fiction und Western und vereinen ihre Kräfte gegen eine geheimnisvolle Invasion der dritten Art.

Die Verfilmung der kultigen Graphic Novel von Scott Mitchell Rosenberg bietet jede Menge geballte Action, außergewöhnliche Spannung, atemberaubende Effekte, gefährliche Stunts und bissigen Humor - ein packendes Blockbuster-Abenteuer mit Sucht-Potential ...

(Paramount Pictures)

Originaltitel: Cybernatural
Horrorthriller, US 2015
Filmverleih: Universal Pictures

---

Ein Jahr ist es her, seit sich High-School-Schönheit Laura (Heather Sossaman) auf der Party eines Mitschülers bis auf die Knochen blamierte. Ein Jahr, seit das Video ihres peinlichen Fehltrittes ins Internet gestellt wurde und Lauras Ruf auf einen Schlag ruinierte. Ein Jahr, seit sich Laura auf tragische Weise das Leben genommen hat. Heute Nacht versammeln sich sechs ihrer Mitschüler auf Skype, um über Lauras Tod zu reden. Bis sich eine unbekannte siebte Person mit Lauras Konto einloggt und alle Anwesenden warnt: Wer versucht, den Chat zu verlassen - stirbt. Wer sich weigert, zu reden - stirbt. Wer die Wahrheit über die Ereignisse im vergangenen Jahr verschweigt - stirbt. Ist Lauras Geist zurückkehrt, um Rache zu nehmen? Oder spielt jemand den sechs Freunden einen grausamen Streich? 

Genrefilmexperte Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Wächter der Nacht, Abraham Lincoln - Vampirjäger) als Produzent und die innovativen visuellen Ideen von Regietalent Levan Gabriadze (Lucky Trouble) lassen Unknown User zum packenden und unvorhersehbaren Horrorthriller mit hochaktuellem Bezug werden: Zwischen Cyber-Bullying, Social-Media-Wahn, FOMO und Always-On-Mentalität trifft Unknown User perfekt den Zeitgeist und wird so zum furchteinflößenden Blair Witch Project für die Generation Web.

Two British comic-book geeks (Simon Pegg & Nick Frost) traveling across the U.S. encounter an alien outside Area 51 who needs their help.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) reunite for the comedy adventure Paul as two sci-fi geeks whose pilgrimage takes them to America's UFO heartland. While there, they accidentally meet an alien who brings them on an insane road trip that alters their universe forever. For the past 60 years, an alien named Paul (Seth Rogen) has been hanging out at a top-secret military base. For reasons unknown, the space-traveling smart ass decides to escape the compound and hop on the first vehicle out of town -- a rented RV containing Earthlings Graeme Willy (Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Frost). Chased by federal agents and the fanatical father of a young woman that they accidentally kidnap, Graeme and Clive hatch a fumbling escape plan to return Paul to his mother ship. And as two nerds struggle to help, one little green man might just take his fellow outcasts from misfits to intergalactic heroes. Paul is directed by Superbad's Greg Mottola, from a story by Pegg & Frost. Joining the comedy's cast are Jason Bateman, Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Blythe Danner, Joe Lo Truglio, John Carroll Lynch, David Koechner and Sigourney Weaver. -

Paul, Apostle of Christ is the story of two men. Luke, as a friend and physician, risks his life every time he ventures into the city of Rome to visit Paul, who is held captive in Nero’s darkest, bleakest prison cell. Before Paul’s death sentence can be enacted, Luke resolves to write another book, one that details the beginnings of “The Way” and the birth of what will come to be known as the church. But Nero is determined to rid Rome of Christians, and does not flinch from executing them in the grisliest ways possible. 
Bound in chains, Paul’s struggle is internal. He has survived so much—floggings, shipwreck, starvation, stoning, hunger and thirst, cold and exposure—yet as he waits for his appointment with death, he is haunted by the shadows of his past misdeeds. Alone in the dark, he wonders if he has been forgotten . . . and if he has the strength to finish well.
Two men struggle against a determined emperor and the frailties of the human spirit in order to bequeath the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the world.","['paul', 'apostle of christ', 'luke', 'rome', 'jim caviezel', 'olivier martinez', 'james faulkner', 'trailer', 'affirm films', 'sony', 'official trailer', 'faith', 'films', 'march 23']",3720185,35482,879,3164,39513,0.29295454545454547

Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a 'mechanic' - an elite assassin with a strict code and unique talent for cleanly eliminating targets.  It's a job that requires professional perfection and total detachment, and Bishop is the best in the business.  But when his mentor and close friend Harry (Donald Sutherland) is murdered, Bishop is anything but detached.  His next assignment is self-imposed - he wants those responsible dead.  His mission grows complicated when Harry's son Steve (Ben Foster) approaches him with the same vengeful goal and a determination to learn Bishop's trade.  Bishop has always acted alone but he can't turn his back on Harry's son.  A methodical hit man takes an impulsive student deep into his world and a deadly partnership is born.  But while in pursuit of their ultimate mark, deceptions threaten to surface and those hired to fix problems become problems themselves.","['trailer', 'film', 'action', 'jason', 'stratham', 'alliance', 'british', 'movie']",60643,86,6,19,27582,0.5074257425742574

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A horror/romance reimagining of the classic story. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke and starring Amanda Seyfried

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) is a beautiful young woman torn between two men. She is in love with a brooding outsider Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), but her parents have arranged for her to marry the wealthy Henry (Max Irons). Unwilling to lose each other, Valerie and Peter are planning to run away together when they learn that Valerie's older sister has been killed by the werewolf that prowls the dark forest surrounding their village. For years, the people have maintained an uneasy truce with the beast, offering the creature a monthly animal sacrifice. But under a blood red moon, the wolf has upped the stakes by taking a human life. Hungry for revenge, the people call on famed werewolf hunter, Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), to help them kill the wolf. But Solomon's arrival brings unintended consequences as he warns that the wolf, who takes human form by day, could be any one of them. As the death toll rises with each moon, Valerie begins to suspect that the werewolf could be someone she loves. Panic grips the town as Valerie discovers that she has a unique connection to the beast-one that inexorably draws them together, making her both suspect...and bait.-

Filled with mind-boggling twists and heart-pounding suspense, Source Code is a smart action-thriller directed by Duncan Jones (Moon) also starring Michelle Monaghan (Eagle Eye, Due Date), Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air, The Departed), and Jeffrey Wright (Quantum of Solace, Syriana).","['Source', 'Code']",77122,166,8,0,45612,0.3605365223012282

Close your eyes. Open your mind. You will be unprepared. ""Sucker Punch"" is an epic action fantasy that takes us into the vivid imagination of a young girl whose dream world provides the ultimate escape from her darker reality. Unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place, she is free to go where her mind takes her, and her incredible adventures blur the lines between what's real and what is imaginary. She has been locked away against her will, but Babydoll (Emily Browning) has not lost her will to survive. Determined to fight for her freedom, she urges four other young girls--the outspoken Rocket (Jena Malone), the street-smart Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), the fiercely loyal Amber (Jamie Chung) and the reluctant Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish)--to band together and try to escape their terrible fate at the hands of their captors, Blue (Oscar Isaac), Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) and the High Roller (Jon Hamm). Led by Babydoll, the girls engage in fantastical warfare against everything from samurais to serpents, with a virtual arsenal at their disposal. Together, they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice in order to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man (Scott Glenn), their unbelievable journey--if they succeed--will set them free.","['Sucker Punch trailer', 'Sucker Punch movie', 'Emily Browning', 'Abbie Cornish', 'Vanessa Hudgens', 'Jamie Chung', 'Jena Malone', 'Carla Gugino', 'Jon Hamm', 'Scott Glenn', 'Oscar Isaac', 'Zack Snyder', 'Steve Shibuya']",1775193,10561,402,937,23629,0.37531380753138077

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Raised by her father, an ex-CIA agent, in the wilds of Finland, Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) lives a life unlike any other teenager. Her upbringing and training have been geared to making her the perfect assassin.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) is 16 years old. She is bright, inquisitive, and a devoted daughter. Uniquely, she has the strength, the stamina, and the smarts of a soldier; these come from being raised by her widowed father Erik (Eric Bana), an ex-CIA man, in the wilds of North Finland. Erik has taught Hanna to hunt, put her through extreme self-defense workouts, and home-schooled her with only an encyclopedia and a book of fairy tales. Hanna has been living a life unlike any other teenager; her upbringing and training have been one and the same, all geared to making her the perfect assassin. But out in the world there is unfinished business for Hanna's family, and it is with a combination of pride and apprehension that Erik realizes his daughter can no longer be held back. -

#LoveAndThunder is a sequel to Thor: Ragnarok, and Avengers: Endgame. The film will adapt a Lady Thor story arc from the recent Marvel Comics series The Mighty Thor. It is the twenty-ninth film in the MCU and sixth and final film of Phase Four.

──────────────────

Following the smash-hit success of his movie Thor: Ragnarok, Taika Waititi is returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe once again to write and direct the fourth installment in the Thor series, Thor: Love and Thunder.

The film will see Natalie Portman’s Jane Foster take on the role of Lady Thor. It’s fair to say that this particular Marvel sequel won’t be one to miss.

Marvel boss Kevin Feige announced at Comic-Con that Natalie Portman will return to the MCU as Jane Foster. But this time around, she will reportedly become a female God of Thunder herself, when Thor is unable to lift his hammer due to apparent unworthiness (a theme previously explored in Avengers: Endgame and in a popular comic-book run that the film is directly inspired by).

On top of this, it’s been confirmed that Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson will return as Thor and Valkyrie.

It’s possible that Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk could appear in the film following his starring role in Thor: Ragnarok (Ruffalo supposedly still has one film left on his Marvel contract), or some team members from the Guardians of the Galaxy, last seen giving Thor a ride into space.

Other upcoming Marvel Studios projects include Black Widow on May 1, 2020, The Falcon and The Winter Soldier in Fall 2020, The Eternals on November 6, 2020, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings on February 12, 2021, WandaVision in Spring 2021, Loki in Spring 2021, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness on May 7, 2021, Spider-Man 3 on July 16, 2021, What If…? in Summer 2021, Hawkeye in Fall 2021, and Black Panther 2 on May 6, 2022. Marvel Studios Disney+ series without release dates include Ms. Marvel, Moon Knight, and She-Hulk.

#Thor4 is due out November 5, 2021.

Annie's life is a mess.  But when she finds out her lifetime best friend is engaged, she simply must serve as Lillian's maid of honor.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Two women battle to plan their friend's wedding party.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Director Paul Feig and producer Judd Apatow team up again for this comedy that stars Kristen Wiig as Annie, a romantically unattached failed bakery owner who fears she's losing her BFF, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), the best thing in her life, when Lillian announces she's gotten engaged. Annie's anxieties deepen as Lillian grows close to Helen (Rose Byrne), a wealthy and beautiful new friend who quickly assumes control of planning all the pre-wedding festivities. On top of the main storyline of a female friendship being torn apart, the movie adds a romantic storyline for Annie, who starts the film answering a booty call from the casually cruel yet undeniably handsome Ted (Jon Hamm), but develops a lovely flirtation with an Irish cop named Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) after he pulls Annie over one night thinking she's driving drunk. As the low-self-esteem Annie sabotages this new possibility for love, she also feels the most important friendship in her life slipping away.

When Jack crosses paths with a woman from his past (Penelope Cruz), he's not sure if it's love—or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the formidable pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know who to fear more:  Blackbeard or the woman from his past.  

The international cast includes franchise vets Geoffrey Rush as the vengeful Captain Hector Barbossa, and Kevin R. McNally as Captain Jack's longtime comrade Joshamee Gibbs, plus Sam Claflin as a stalwart missionary and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as a mysterious mermaid.  In theaters Memorial Day weekend, 2011.

제가 좋아하는 영화 중 하나인 미드나잇 인 파리를 예고편으로 제작해보았습니다.


매일 밤 12시, 시간을 넘나드는 로맨스가 시작된다!

약혼자 '이네즈'(레이첼 맥아담스)를 두고 
홀로 파리의 밤거리를 배회하던 '길'(오웬 윌슨)은 
종소리와 함께 꿈처럼 시간 여행을 하게 된다.

 그곳에서 1920년대를 대표하는 예술가들과 조우하는 길. 
  
 그 날 이후 매일 밤 1920년대로 떠난 '길'은 
 평소에 동경하던 예술가들과 친구가 되어 꿈 같은 시간을 보내게 되고 
 헤밍웨이와 피카소의 연인이자 뮤즈인 ‘아드리아나’(마리옹 꼬띠아르)를 
 만나게 된다. 시간이 지날수록 ‘길’은 예술과 낭만을 사랑하는 
 매혹적인 그녀에게 빠져들게 되는데… 
  
 세기를 초월한 사랑은 이뤄질 수 있을까?

TERRENCE MALICK has always created thought-provoking, intensely visual and viscerally emotional films of our times, each one a distinct experience rife with mystery and depth.   His new film, THE TREE OF LIFE, may be simultaneously his most intimate and epic work yet. A hymn to life, it excavates answers to the most haunting and personal human questions through a kaleidoscope of the intimate and the cosmic, from the raw emotions of a family in a small Texas town to the wildest, infinite edges of space and time, from a boy's loss of innocence to a man's transforming encounters with awe, wonder and transcendence.
