New Line Cinema’s horror thriller “IT,” directed by Andrés Muschietti (“Mama”), is based on the hugely popular Stephen King novel of the same name, which has been terrifying readers for decades.

When children begin to disappear in the town of Derry, Maine, a group of young kids are faced with their biggest fears when they square off against an evil clown named Pennywise, whose history of murder and violence dates back for centuries.  

“IT” stars Bill Skarsgård (“Allegiant,” TV’s “Hemlock Grove”) as the story’s central villain, Pennywise.  An ensemble of young actors also star in the film, including Jaeden Lieberher (“Midnight Special”), Jeremy Ray Taylor (“Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip”), Sophia Lillis (“37”), Finn Wolfhard (TV’s “Stranger Things”), Wyatt Oleff (“Guardians of the Galaxy”), Chosen Jacobs (upcoming “Cops and Robbers”), Jack Dylan Grazer (“Tales of Halloween”) and Nicholas Hamilton (“Captain Fantastic”).

Muschietti is directing “IT” from a screenplay adapted by Chase Palmer & Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman.  Dan Lin, Roy Lee, Seth Grahame-Smith, David Katzenberg and Barbara Muschietti are producing, with Marty P. Ewing, Doug Davison and Jon Silk serving as executive producers.

The behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Chung-Hoon Chung (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl”), production designer Claude Paré (“Rise of the Planet of the Apes”), editor Jason Ballantine (“The Great Gatsby”), and costume designer Janie Bryant (TV’s “Mad Men”).

Evil resurfaces in Derry as director Andy Muschietti reunites the Losers Club—young and adult—in a return to where it all began with “It Chapter Two.”

The film is Muschietti’s follow-up to 2017’s critically acclaimed and massive worldwide box office hit “IT,” which grossed over $700 million globally.  Both redefining and transcending the genre, “IT” became part of the cultural zeitgeist as well as the highest-grossing horror film of all time.

Because every 27 years evil revisits the town of Derry, Maine, “It Chapter Two” brings the characters—who’ve long since gone their separate ways—back together as adults, nearly three decades after the events of the first film.  

Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain (“Zero Dark Thirty,” “Mama”) stars as Beverly, James McAvoy (“Split,” upcoming “Glass”) as Bill, Bill Hader (HBO’s “Barry,” “The Skeleton Twins”) as Richie, Isaiah Mustafa (TV’s “Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments”) as Mike, Jay Ryan (TV’s “Mary Kills People”) as Ben, James Ransone (HBO’s “The Wire”) as Eddie, and Andy Bean (“Allegiant,” Starz’ “Power”) as Stanley.  Reprising their roles as the original members of the Losers Club are Jaeden Martell as Bill, Wyatt Oleff as Stanley, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie, Finn Wolfhard as Richie, Sophia Lillis as Beverly, Chosen Jacobs as Mike, and Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben.  Bill Skarsgård returns in the seminal role of Pennywise.  

Muschietti directed the film from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman (“IT,” “Annabelle: Creation”) based on the novel IT by Stephen King.  Barbara Muschietti, Dan Lin and Roy Lee produced the film, with Marty Ewing, Seth Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg serving as the executive producers.

The behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Checco Varese (“The 33”), Oscar-winning production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“The Shape of Water”), editor Jason Ballantine (“IT,” “Mad Max: Fury Road”), and Oscar-nominated costume designer Luis Sequeira (“The Shape of Water,” “Mama”).  The music is by Benjamin Wallfisch (“Shazam!,” “Blade Runner 2049,” “IT”). 

New Line Cinema presents, a Vertigo Entertainment/Rideback Production, an Andy Muschietti film, “It Chapter Two.”  The film is slated for release in theaters and IMAX on September 6, 2019 and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

The Emoji Movie unlocks the never-before-seen secret world inside your smartphone. Hidden within the messaging app is Textopolis, a bustling city where all your favorite emojis live, hoping to be selected by the phone’s user. In this world, each emoji has only one facial expression – except for Gene (T.J. Miller), an exuberant emoji who was born without a filter and is bursting with multiple expressions. Determined to become “normal” like the other emojis, Gene enlists the help of his handy best friend Hi-5 (James Corden) and the notorious code breaker emoji Jailbreak (Anna Faris). Together, they embark on an epic “app-venture” through the apps on the phone, each its own wild and fun world, to find the Code that will fix Gene. But when a greater danger threatens the phone, the fate of all emojis depends on these three unlikely friends who must save their world before it’s deleted forever.  

Directed by Tony Leondis. 
Written by Tony Leondis & Eric Siegel and Mike White. 
Produced by Michelle Raimo Kouyate.

Den kürzlichen Tod seiner Teenager-Tochter hat er noch nicht überwunden, da stolpert er in der Wildnis über die Leiche einer vergewaltigten und erfrorenen Jugendlichen. Um den Täter zu fassen, wird die noch sehr junge FBI-Agentin Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) auf den Fall angesetzt. Weil sie sich in dem rauen Gelände und mit den schwierigen Wetterverhältnissen vor Ort allerdings nicht auskennt, bittet sie Cory um Hilfe bei ihren Ermittlungen und gemeinsam brechen sie auf ins Ungewisse.

WIND RIVER follows tracker CORY LAMBERT (Jeremy Renner) as he is forced to confront his past when he joins a rookie FBI agent in a quest to solve a murder on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming.

Cory Lambert discovers a body in the rugged wilderness of the Wind River Indian Reservation. The situation is eerily similar to the death of his own daughter. The FBI sends rookie agent JANE BANNER (Elizabeth Olsen) to investigate. A Florida native, Jane is completely unprepared for the oppressive weather and isolation that is the essence of winter in Wyoming, and the extreme difficulties it places of the investigation. She employs Cory as a guide and tracker to assist her.

Together, they venture deep into a world ravaged by violence and the elements. While Jane is compelled to rely more on her instincts than her education, Cory is forced to confront emotions buried years ago as the possibility of solving not only this murder, but also the disappearance of his daughter, unfolds before him.

WIND RIVER is a stark look at life on the edge of the largest wilderness in the lower 48, where the rule of law is eclipsed by the laws of nature. Jane will be forced to face her greatest weaknesses as a search for answers becomes a fight for survival.

In Universal Pictures’ American Made, Tom Cruise reunites with his Edge of Tomorrow director, Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Mr. and Mrs. Smith), in this international escapade based on the outrageous (and real) exploits of a hustler and pilot unexpectedly recruited by the CIA to run one of the biggest covert operations in U.S. history.

Based on a true story, American Made co-stars Domhnall Gleeson, Sarah Wright, E. Roger Mitchell, Jesse Plemons, Lola Kirke, Alejandro Edda, Benito Martinez, Caleb Landry Jones and Jayma Mays.

The film is produced by Imagine Entertainment’s Academy Award®-winning producer Brian Grazer (A Beautiful Mind), Cross Creek Pictures’ Brian Oliver (Black Swan) and Tyler Thompson (Everest), Quadrant Pictures’ Doug Davison (The Departed), and Kim Roth (Inside Man).  Gary Spinelli wrote the screenplay.

EqPnIcDW9g0,FREAKY - Official Trailer (HD),Universal Pictures,UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw,"In theaters Friday the 13th of November
https://www.freaky.movie

This November, on Friday the 13th, prepare to get Freaky with a twisted take on the body-swap movie when a teenage girl switches bodies with a relentless serial killer.  

Seventeen-year-old Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton, Blockers, HBO’s Big Little Lies) is just trying to survive the bloodthirsty halls of Blissfield High and the cruelty of the popular crowd. But when she becomes the newest target of The Butcher (Vince Vaughn), her town’s infamous serial killer, her senior year becomes the least of her worries. 

When The Butcher’s mystical ancient dagger causes him and Millie to wake up in each other’s bodies, Millie learns that she has just 24 hours to get her body back before the switch becomes permanent and she’s trapped in the form of a middle-aged maniac forever. The only problem is she now looks like a towering psychopath who’s the target of a city-wide manhunt while The Butcher looks like her and has brought his appetite for carnage to Homecoming.

With some help from her friends—ultra-woke Nyla (Celeste O’Connor, Ghostbusters: Afterlife), ultra-fabulous Joshua (Misha Osherovich, The Goldfinch) and her crush Booker (Uriah Shelton, Enter the Warriors Gate)—Millie races against the clock to reverse the curse while The Butcher discovers that having a female teen body is the perfect cover for a little Homecoming killing spree. 

The film also stars Alan Ruck (HBO’s Succession), Katie Finneran (TV’s Why Women Kill) and Dana Drori (Hulu’s High Fidelity). 

From the deliciously debased mind of writer-director Christopher Landon (Happy Death Day, the Paranormal Activity franchise) comes a pitch-black horror-comedy about a slasher, a senior, and the brutal truth about high school.  

Freaky is written by Christopher Landon and Michael Kennedy (Fox’s Bordertown) and is produced by Jason Blum (Halloween, The Invisible Man). The film is produced by Blumhouse Productions in association with Divide/Conquer. The executive producers are Couper Samuelson and Jeanette Volturno.",2020-09-10T13:00:23Z,[],34724104,26898,1052,3369,440021,0.19592976855546687

Jessica Rothe leads the returning cast of HAPPY DEATH DAY 2U, the follow-up to Blumhouse’s (Split, Get Out, The Purge series) surprise 2017 smash hit of riveting, repeating twists and comic turns.  This time, our hero Tree Gelbman (Rothe) discovers that dying over and over was surprisingly easier than the dangers that lie ahead.

Jason Blum once again produces and Christopher Landon returns to write and direct this next chapter, while Happy Death Day executive producers Angela Mancuso and John Baldecchi are newly joined by EP Samson Mucke (Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse).

In LADY BIRD, Greta Gerwig reveals herself to be a bold new cinematic voice with her directorial debut, excavating both the humor and pathos in the turbulent bond between a mother and her teenage daughter.  Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) fights against but is exactly like her wildly loving, deeply opinionated and strong-willed mom (Laurie Metcalf), a nurse working tirelessly to keep her family afloat after Lady Bird's father (Tracy Letts) loses his job.  Set in Sacramento, California in 2002, amidst a rapidly shifting American economic landscape, Lady Bird is an affecting look at the relationships that shape us, the beliefs that define us, and the unmatched beauty of a place called home.

¿Qué pasaría si pudiéramos reencontrarnos con nuestros familiares fallecidos hace tiempo? A partir de la colorida celebración mexicana del Día de los Muertos, Coco nos descubre el misterio de compartir la reunión familiar más extraordinaria y sorprendente, incluso con aquellos antepasados que murieron muchos años atrás. 
La historia sigue a un niño de doce años de edad llamado Miguel, que vive con su familia en una zona rural de México, y cuyo sueño es la música y tocar la guitarra. Miguel desencadenará una serie de acontecimientos extraordinarios relacionados con un misterio centenario. La festividad del Día de los Muertos servirá como telón de fondo para que nuestro protagonista se pregunte de dónde viene, cuál es su lugar dentro de su familia, y cómo se han entretejido las relaciones familiares a través del tiempo. Una celebración de la vida, de la familia, los recuerdos y la conexión a través de diversas generaciones.

DARKEST HOUR, a Focus Features presentation of a Working Title Films Production.
A thrilling and inspiring true story begins on the eve of World War II as, within days of becoming Prime Minister of Great Britain, Winston Churchill (Academy Award nominee Gary Oldman) must face one of his most turbulent and defining trials: exploring a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany, or standing firm to fight for the ideals, liberty and freedom of a nation. As the unstoppable Nazi forces roll across Western Europe and the threat of invasion is imminent, and with an unprepared public, a skeptical King, and his own party plotting against him, Churchill must withstand his darkest hour, rally a nation, and attempt to change the course of world history.

For the US, it will launch tomorrow! And I'm here to promote the film. How to? Like the old fashion way, creating an Inside Out crossover! That means the videos where the Inside Out Emotions watch the latest Disney Trailers or features! And this time is Inside Out Emotions Watching Star Wars…not the Force Awakens Trailer, but the LAST JEDI trailer! There has been a lot of clues of Rey joining the dark side in this movie. Is it true in the end? I don't know, neither the emotions. So they have a few reactions about this trailer. The trailer is more filled with darkness than the previous one (Episode VII), so please don't mind that they haven't cheered in the end of the trailer just like the other videos. You might just hear the worrying yells of Fear. Anger can't control his temper well as the force was too strong, while Disgust starts to think Kylo Ren is cool. I've also improved the audio quality of the dialogues. Hopefully you guys would like it, and hope it could attract more people to watch this movie. It's really thrilling. Oh yes, and please note that the story took place in November, which explains why Sadness said December's a long long way.

Stay tuned! Hong Kong Disneyland Imagineering Ep 8 is still in preparation! In the meantime, be sure to check out the other episodes of Hong Kong Disneyland Imagineering! OR check out other Inside Out Emotions Watching Trailers! And remember to please like this video and subscribe this channel!

Aaron Sorkin (guionista de Steve Jobs y La Red Social) hace su debut como director en este biopic sobre Molly Bloom, una esquiadora profesional, que desde empezó a caminar, es a partes iguales talentosa, brillante y testaruda. Tras no haber podido entrar en el equipo olímpico, decidió tomarse un año sabático antes de comenzar en escuela de derecho, con la intención de conseguir un trabajo como camarera en Los Ángeles y disfrutar de un clima cálido durante un tiempo. 
Debido a un cúmulo de casualidades, así como a sus habilidades empresariales sin explotar, terminó haciendo millones mediante la ejecución, durante ocho años, de las más exclusivas y clandestinas apuestas de póker. Su vida se vino abajo cuando 17 agentes del FBI armados fueron en su búsqueda para detenerla.

""Molly's Game"" erzählt die spektakuläre, wahre Geschichte von Molly Bloom einer ehemaligen olympischen Skifahrerin, die über zehn Jahre hinweg den exklusivsten geheimen Poker-Ring der Welt betrieben hat. Als sie eines Nachts von schwer bewaffneten FBI-Agenten festgenommen wird, bedeutet es das Ende ihrer kriminellen Karriere. Zu ihren Poker-Gästen gehörten Hollywood-Stars, Sportgrößen, erfolgreiche Geschäftsleute und zuletzt auch - von ihr angeblich unbemerkt - die russische Mafia. Nach ihrer Verhaftung wird Rechtsanwalt Charlie Jaffey zu ihrem engsten Verbündeten. Doch um Molly zu verteidigen, muss Jaffey hundertprozentig von ihrer Unschuld überzeugt sein: Wie viel wusste sie wirklich von illegalen Machenschaften hinter den Kulissen ihrer Pokernächte? Und warum besteht sie darauf, die Namen ihrer prominenten Kunden zu verschweigen? Welches Spiel spielt Molly Bloom wirklich?

Steven Spielberg directs Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks in The Post, a thrilling drama about the unlikely partnership between The Washington Post’s Katharine Graham (Streep), the first female publisher of a major American newspaper, and editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks), as they race to catch up with The New York Times to expose a massive cover-up of government secrets that spanned three decades and four U.S. Presidents. The two must overcome their differences as they risk their careers – and their very freedom – to help bring long-buried truths to light.

The Post marks the first time Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have collaborated on a project. In addition to directing, Spielberg produces along with Amy Pascal and Kristie Macosko Krieger. The script was written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, and the film features an acclaimed ensemble cast including Alison Brie, Carrie Coon, David Cross, Bruce Greenwood, Tracy Letts, Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, Jesse Plemons, Matthew Rhys, Michael Stuhlbarg, Bradley Whitford and Zach Woods.

Set in the glamour of 1950’s post-war London, renowned dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his sister Cyril (Lesley Manville) are at the center of British fashion, dressing royalty, movie stars, heiresses, socialites, debutants and dames with the distinct style of The House of Woodcock.  Women come and go through Woodcock’s life, providing the confirmed bachelor with inspiration and companionship, until he comes across a young, strong-willed woman, Alma (Vicky Krieps), who soon becomes a fixture in his life as his muse and lover. Once controlled and planned, he finds his carefully tailored life disrupted by love.  With his latest film, Paul Thomas Anderson paints an illuminating portrait both of an artist on a creative journey, and the women who keep his world running. Phantom Thread is Paul Thomas Anderson’s eighth movie, and his second collaboration with Daniel Day-Lewis.

Seit 10 Jahren pendelt der Versicherungsmakler Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) jeden Tag aus seinem beschaulichen Vorort nach Manhattan und zurück. Doch als er nach einem harten Tag mal wieder in den ewig gleichen Zug einsteigt, ist alles anders. Die Fremde Joanna (Vera Farmiga) setzt sich zu ihm und verspricht ihm eine hohe Belohnung, wenn er für sie einen ganz bestimmten Passagier findet, der etwas sehr Wertvolles zu transportieren scheint. Michael erhält nur zwei Hinweise: Einen falschen Namen und den Zielbahnhof des Unbekannten. Als er zögert, macht Joanna ihm unmissverständlich klar: Sie hat nicht nur das Leben der Passagiere in ihrer Hand, sondern auch das von Michaels Familie. Michael ist Teil einer kriminellen Verschwörung geworden. Er kann nur mitspielen, oder einen Ausweg finden – und ihm bleibt nur eine Stunde Zeit.

Dominika Egorova is many things. A devoted daughter determined to protect her mother at all costs. A prima ballerina whose ferocity has pushed her body and mind to the absolute limit. A master of seductive and manipulative combat.
 
When she suffers a career-ending injury, Dominika and her mother are facing a bleak and uncertain future. That is why she finds herself manipulated into becoming the newest recruit for Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people like her to use their bodies and minds as weapons. After enduring the perverse and sadistic training process, she emerges as the most dangerous Sparrow the program has ever produced. Dominika must now reconcile the person she was with the power she now commands, with her own life and everyone she cares about at risk, including an American CIA agent who tries to convince her he is the only person she can trust.

Screenplay by: Justin Haythe

Als eine Verletzung ihrer Karriere ein Ende setzt, sehen Dominika (Jennifer Lawrence) und ihre Mutter einer trostlosen und unsicheren Zukunft entgegen. Daher lässt sie sich schnell dazu überreden, eine der neusten Rekruten der Sparrow School zu werden, einem Geheimdienst, der außergewöhnliche junge Menschen wie sie trainiert, ihren Körper und Verstand als Waffe einzusetzen. Nachdem sie den abartigen und brutalen Trainingsprozess überstanden hat, entwickelt sie sich zum gefährlichsten Sparrow, den das Programm je hervorgebracht hat. Dominika muss ihr Leben auf ihre neue machtvolle Situation abstimmen und das betrifft auch alle ihr nahestehenden Menschen, die sich durch sie in Gefahr befinden -  darunter auch ein amerikanischer CIA Agent (Joel Edgerton), der versucht, sie davon zu überzeugen, dass er die einzige Person ist, der sie trauen kann.

Jason Bateman (the “Horrible Bosses” films, TV’s “Arrested Development,” “Ozark”) and Oscar nominee Rachel McAdams (“Spotlight,” “Dr. Strange”) team up in New Line Cinema’s action comedy “Game Night.”  John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein are directing the film, marking their second film as co-directors, following “Vacation.”
  
Joining Bateman and McAdams in the cast are Billy Magnussen (“Bridge of Spies,” TV’s “American Crime Story”), Sharon Horgan (Amazon’s “Catastrophe”), Lamorne Morris (TV’s “New Girl”), Kylie Bunbury (TV’s “Pitch,” “Under the Dome”), Jesse Plemons (“Black Mass,” TV’s “Fargo”), Danny Huston (“Wonder Woman,” “X-Men Origins: Wolverine”), Chelsea Peretti (TV’s “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”), with Michael C. Hall (TV’s “Dexter” and “Six Feet Under”) and Kyle Chandler (“Manchester by the Sea,” TV’s “Bloodline”).

Bateman and McAdams star as Max and Annie, whose weekly couples game night gets kicked up a notch when Max’s charismatic brother, Brooks (Chandler), arranges a murder mystery party, complete with fake thugs and faux federal agents. So when Brooks gets kidnapped, it’s all part of the game…right?  But as the six uber-competitive gamers set out to solve the case and win, they begin to discover that neither this “game”—nor Brooks—are what they seem to be.  Over the course of one chaotic night, the friends find themselves increasingly in over their heads as each twist leads to another unexpected turn.  With no rules, no points, and no idea who all the players are, this could turn out to be the most fun they’ve ever had…or game over.

“Game Night” is written by Mark Perez (“Accepted”).  John Davis (“Joy”), John Fox (TV’s “The Blacklist”), Jason Bateman and Jim Garavente (“Bad Words”) are producing. Serving as executive producers are Marc S. Fischer, Richard Brener, Michael Disco and Dave Neustadter.

The behind-the-scenes team includes director of photography Barry Peterson (“Central Intelligence,” “We’re the Millers”), Oscar-nominated production designer Michael Corenblith (“How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” “Apollo 13”), editors Jamie Gross (“Vacation”), Gregory Plotkin (“Get Out”) and David Egan (“Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return”), and costume designer Debra McGuire (“Vacation,” “Ted”).

The film will be released worldwide beginning February 23, 2018.
“Game Night” is a New Line Cinema presentation and will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment company.

Max (Jason Bateman) und Annie's (Rachel McAdams) wöchentliche Spieleabende für Paare erreichen ein völlig neues Niveau, als Max’ charismatischer Bruder Brooks (Kyle Chandler) eine Mordfall-Ermittlungsparty arrangiert – inklusive falscher Gangster und Pseudo-FBI-Agenten. Als Brooks dann gekidnappt wird, gehört das natürlich zum Spiel … oder? Doch als die sechs ehrgeizigen Spieler ihre Ermittlungen aufnehmen und verbissen um den Sieg kämpfen, begreifen sie allmählich, dass weder dieses „Spiel“ noch Brooks selbst das sind, was sie zu sein vorgeben. Im Laufe dieser total chaotischen Nacht geraten die Freunde bis über die Ohren in einen Schlamassel, dem keiner von ihnen gewachsen ist, weil sie durch ständig neue Wendungen verblüfft werden. Da es keine Regeln, keine Punkte und auch keine Anhaltspunkte gibt, wer hier eigentlich die Finger im Spiel hat, könnte sich dieses Erlebnis zum größten Spaß aller Zeiten entwickeln, oder für alle das plötzliche Aus bedeuten!

Official Trailer 2 - http://www.pacificrimmovie.com 

The globe-spanning conflict between otherworldly monsters of mass destruction and the human-piloted super-machines built to vanquish them was only a prelude to the all-out assault on humanity in Pacific Rim Uprising. 

John Boyega (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) stars as the rebellious Jake Pentecost, a once-promising Jaeger pilot whose legendary father gave his life to secure humanity’s victory against the monstrous “Kaiju.” Jake has since abandoned his training only to become caught up in a criminal underworld. But when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through our cities and bring the world to its knees, he is given one last chance to live up to his father’s legacy by his estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)—who is leading a brave new generation of pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war. As they seek justice for the fallen, their only hope is to unite together in a global uprising against the forces of extinction. 

Jake is joined by gifted rival pilot Lambert (The Fate of the Furious’ Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), as the heroes of the PPDC become the only family he has left. Rising up to become the most powerful defense force to ever walk the earth, they will set course for a spectacular all-new adventure on a towering scale. 

Pacific Rim Uprising is directed by Steven S. DeKnight (Netflix’s Daredevil, STARZ’s Spartacus) and also stars Jing Tian, Burn Gorman, Adria Arjona and Charlie Day.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Olivia, Lucas and a group of their college friends travel to Mexico for one last getaway before graduation. While there, a stranger convinces one of the students to play a seemingly harmless game of truth or dare with the others. Once the game starts, it awakens something evil -- a demon which forces the friends to share dark secrets and confront their deepest fears. The rules are simple but wicked -- tell the truth or die, do the dare or die, and if you stop playing, you die.

In 1993, a breakthrough new technology, known as 
CRISPR, gave scientists a path to treat incurable 
diseases through genetic editing.

In 2016, due to its potential for misuse, the U.S.
Intelligence Community designated genetic editing a
“Weapon of Mass Destruction and Proliferation.”

Global icon Dwayne Johnson headlines the action adventure “Rampage,” directed by Brad Peyton.   

Johnson stars as primatologist Davis Okoye, a man who keeps people at a distance but shares an unshakable bond with George, the extraordinarily intelligent, incredibly rare albino silverback gorilla who has been in his care since he rescued the young orphan from poachers.  But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  

To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with discredited geneticist Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris) to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   

“Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”), and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (TV’s “Rise”), Breanne Hill (TV’s “Frontier”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”), Jason Liles (“Death Note”), Demetrius Grosse (TV’s “The Brave”), and Will Yun Lee (TV’s “Hawaii Five-O”).  

Peyton directed from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle.  
“Rampage” was produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton, Flynn and Garcia, following the international blockbuster hit “San Andreas,” Warner Bros.’ highest grossing film of 2015, as well as 2012’s global smash “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”  Executive producers were Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco.  

The creative team includes director of photography Jaron Presant, production designer Barry Chusid, editors Jim May and Bob Ducsay, and costume designer Melissa Bruning.  The music is composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”  Serving as co-producers were Wendy Jacobson, Josh Mack and Dana Robin.

The “Rampage” creatures were brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause, with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital.

A New Line Cinema presentation, in association with ASAP Entertainment, a Wrigley Pictures / F.P.C. / 7 Bucks Entertainment production, a Brad Peyton Film, “Rampage” will be distributed in 2D and 3D in select theaters, and IMAX, by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.

It’s been four years since theme park and luxury resort Jurassic World was destroyed by dinosaurs out of containment.  Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles.

When the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event.  Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission.  Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.

With all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before.

NooW_RbfdWI,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom - Official Trailer #2 [HD],Universal Pictures,UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw,"It’s been four years since theme park and luxury resort Jurassic World was destroyed by dinosaurs out of containment. Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. 

When the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission. Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.

With all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before. Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. 

Stars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles. 

Directed by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible), the epic action-adventure is written by Jurassic World’s director, Trevorrow, and its co-writer, Derek Connolly. Producers Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley once again partner with Spielberg and Trevorrow in leading the filmmakers for this stunning installment. Belén Atienza joins the team as a producer.

In “Incredibles 2,” Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is called on to lead a campaign to bring Supers back, while Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) navigates the day-to-day heroics of “normal” life at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), Dash (voice of Huck Milner) and baby Jack-Jack—whose super powers are about to be discovered. Their mission is derailed, however, when a new villain emerges with a brilliant and dangerous plot that threatens everything. But the Parrs don’t shy away from a challenge, especially with Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) by their side. That’s what makes this family so Incredible.
 
Written and directed by Brad Bird (“Iron Giant,” “The Incredibles,” “Ratatouille”) and produced by John Walker (“The Incredibles,” “Tomorrowland”) and Nicole Grindle (“Sanjay’s Super Team” short, “Toy Story 3” associate producer), Disney•Pixar’s “Incredibles 2” busts into theaters on June 15, 2018.

Everyone’s favorite family of superheroes is back in “Incredibles 2” – but this time Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is in the spotlight, leaving Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell) and Dash (voice of Huck Milner) to navigate the day-to-day heroics of “normal” life. It’s a tough transistion for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby Jack-Jack’s emerging superpowers. When a new villain hatches a brilliant and dangerous plot, the family and Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) must find a way to work together again—which is easier said than done, even when they’re all Incredible. Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) is left to care for Jack-Jack while Helen (Elastigirl) is out saving the world.

UL29y0ah92w,The First Purge – Official Trailer [HD],Universal Pictures,UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw,"Announcing the commencement of #TheFirstPurge. In theaters July 4. 

Behind every tradition lies a revolution.  Next Independence Day, witness the rise of our country’s 12 hours of annual lawlessness.  Welcome to the movement that began as a simple experiment: The First Purge.
 
To push the crime rate below one percent for the rest of the year, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) test a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community.  But when the violence of oppressors meets the rage of the marginalized, the contagion will explode from the trial-city borders and spread across the nation.

Coming off the most successful film in the series, The Purge: Election Year, creator James DeMonaco (writer/director of The Purge, The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year) returns alongside the producers of this worldwide phenomenon: Blumhouse Productions’ Jason Blum (Insidious series, Get Out, Split), Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ouija series, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and DeMonaco’s longtime production partner, Sébastien K. Lemercier (Assault on Precinct 13, Four Lovers).  

The First Purge is directed by Gerard McMurray (Burning Sands), working from a screenplay once again written by DeMonaco.  www.thefirstpurge.com

Official Trailer 
http://www.thepurgeelectionyear.com

Expanding the universe introduced in the hit franchise that electrified the culture and earned $200 million at the worldwide box office, Universal Pictures’ The Purge: Election Year reveals the next terrifying chapter that occurs over 12 hours of annual lawlessness sanctioned by the New Founders of America to keep this country great.
 
It’s been two years since Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) stopped himself from a regrettable act of revenge on Purge Night.  Now serving as head of security for Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell), his mission is to protect her in a run for president and survive the annual ritual that targets the poor and innocent.  But when a betrayal forces them onto the streets of D.C. on the one night when no help is available, they must stay alive until dawn…or both be sacrificed for their sins against the state.
 
Once again returning to collaborate with franchise creator James DeMonaco on The Purge: Election Year are the series’ producers: Blumhouse Productions’ Jason Blum (Insidious and Ouija series, The Visit), Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ouija series, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and writer/director DeMonaco’s longtime production partner, Sébastien K. Lemercier (Assault on Precinct 13, Four Lovers).

The Movie grossed more than $600 million around the world, you are invited to return to the magical Greek island of Kalokairi in an all-new original musical based on the songs of ABBA.  With the film’s original cast returning and new additions including Lily James (Cinderella, Baby Driver), the musical comedy will open on July 20, 2018.

Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, producers of the original film.  Craymer is also the creator and producer of the worldwide smash-hit stage musical.  

Ol Parker, writer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, writes and directs the sequel from a story by Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis and Parker.  Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus return to provide music and lyrics and serve as executive producers.  Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Phyllida Lloyd, Richard Curtis and Nicky Kentish Barnes also serve as executive producers.

Reprising their roles from Mamma Mia! The Movie are Academy Award® winner Meryl Streep as Donna, Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper reunite as Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Oscar® winner Colin Firth return to play Sophie’s three possible dads: Sam, Bill and Harry.

As the film goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present, James will play the role of Young Donna.  Filling the roles of Young Rosie and Young Tanya are Alexa Davies (A Brilliant Young Mind) and Jessica Keenan Wynn (Broadway’s Beautiful).  Young Sam will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), while Young Bill is Josh Dylan (Allied) and Young Harry is Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends).

Baanbrekend regisseur Spike Lee is terug met de provocerende film BlacKkKlansman, gebaseerd op het leven van Ron Stallworth.

Deze politieman uit Colorado Springs slaagde er als eerste Afro-Amerikaanse agent in om te infiltreren in de Ku Klux Klan. Detective Stallworth (John David Washington) en zijn partner Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) wisten tot in de hoogste kringen van de KKK binnen te dringen. Hun doel was de plannen van deze geheime, extremistische organisatie om de macht over te nemen in de stad, te dwarsbomen. 

Spike Lee (Inside Man, Malcolm X, Do the Right Thing) vertelt op zijn kenmerkende directe, maar tevens humorvolle wijze dit ongelooflijke verhaal dat je in de meeste geschiedenisboeken niet tegenkomt. Geproduceerd door het team achter het Oscarwinnende Get Out. 

BlacKkKlansman is geproduceerd door Sean McKittrick en Raymond Mansfield namens QC Entertainment, door Jason Blum namens Blumhouse, door Jordan Peele namens Monkeypaw, door Spike Lee zelf, en door Shaun Redick. Edward H. Hamm Jr. van QC trad op als uitvoerend producent.",2018-07-03T14:09:18Z,"['universalpictures.nl', 'Universal', 'Pictures', 'UPInl', 'Universal Nederland', 'ondertiteld', 'trailer', 'clips', 'making of', 'featurette']",49118,64,13,3,487558,0.21875

Die frühen 1970er-Jahre, eine Zeit großer gesellschaftlicher Umbrüche: Der junge Polizist Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) tritt als erster Afroamerikaner seinen Posten als Kriminalbeamter im Colorado Springs Police Department an. Entschlossen, sich einen Namen zu machen, startet der unerschrockene Cop eine aberwitzige und gefährliche Mission: den Ku-Klux-Klan zu infiltrieren und bloßzustellen. Stallworth gibt vor, ein eingefleischter Extremist zu sein, und nimmt telefonisch Kontakt zur lokalen Gruppe der Rassistenvereinigung auf. Es gelingt ihm tatsächlich, schnell in den inneren Kreis vorzudringen. Er imitiert die Sprache der hasserfüllten Rassisten so überzeugend, dass er sogar das Vertrauen des Klanführers David Duke (Topher Grace) gewinnt. Als die Undercover-Mission zunehmend komplexer wird, übernimmt Stallworths Kollege Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) Rons Rolle in den persönlichen Treffen. Dort erlangt er Insiderwissen über einen tödlichen Plan. Gemeinsam machen sich Stallworth und Zimmerman daran, die Organisation zu Fall zu bringen.

Filmmaker James Wan, director of the record-setting horror hits “The Conjuring” and “The Conjuring 2,” explores another dark corner of that universe with “The Nun.”  Directed by Corin Hardy (“The Hallow”), the new fright-fest is produced by Wan and by Peter Safran, who has produced all the films in “The Conjuring” franchise.  

When a young nun at a cloistered abbey in Romania takes her own life, a priest with a haunted past and a novitiate on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate.  Together they uncover the order’s unholy secret.  Risking not only their lives but their faith and their very souls, they confront a malevolent force in the form of the same demonic nun that first terrorized audiences in “The Conjuring 2,” as the abbey becomes a horrific battleground between the living and the damned.  

“The Nun” stars Oscar nominated Demian Bichir (“A Better Life”) as Father Burke, Taissa Farmiga (TV’s “American Horror Story”) as Sister Irene, and Jonas Bloquet (“Elle”) as local villager Frenchie. 

The cast also includes Charlotte Hope (TV’s “Game of Thrones”) as the abbey’s Sister Victoria, Ingrid Bisu (“Toni Erdmann”) as Sister Oana, and Bonnie Aarons, reprising her “Conjuring 2” role as the title character. 

Hardy directs “The Nun” from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman (“It”), story by James Wan & Gary Dauberman.  Dauberman, Todd Williams and Michael Clear are the executive producers.

Joining Hardy behind the scenes are director of photography Maxime Alexandre (“The Voices,” “Annabelle: Creation”), production designer Jennifer Spence (“Annabelle: Creation,” “Lights Out,” the “Insidious” films), editors Michel Aller (“Lights Out,” “Paranormal Activity: Ghost Dimension”) and Ken Blackwell ( “Ouija” “Friday the 13th”), and costume designer Sharon Gilham (TV’s “Black Mirror”).  The music is by Abel Korzeniowski (“Nocturnal Animals”).     
                  
New Line Cinema presents an Atomic Monster / Safran Company production, “The Nun.” Opening in theaters on September 7, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.",2018-06-13T12:00:24Z,"['James Wan', 'The Conjuring', 'The Conjuring 2', 'Corin Hardy', 'The Nun', 'Peter Safran', 'Demian Bichir', 'Taissa Farmiga', 'Jonas Bloquet', 'Charlotte Hope', 'Ingrid Bisu', 'Bonnie Aarons', 'Gary Dauberman', 'Todd Williams', 'Michael Clear', 'Annabelle', 'New Line', 'New Line Cinema', 'Warner Bros.', 'WB']",45754692,341499,15461,25502,439079,0.5364936042136945

—
Jon M. Chu (“Now You See Me 2”) directed the contemporary romantic comedy “Crazy Rich Asians,” based on the acclaimed worldwide bestseller by Kevin Kwan.

The story follows New Yorker Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) as she accompanies her longtime boyfriend, Nick Young (Henry Golding), to his best friend’s wedding in Singapore.  Excited about visiting Asia for the first time but nervous about meeting Nick’s family, Rachel is unprepared to learn that Nick has neglected to mention a few key details about his life.  Not only is he the scion of one of the country’s wealthiest families, but also one of its most sought-after bachelors.  Being on Nick’s arm puts a target on Rachel’s back, with jealous socialites and, worse, Nick’s own disapproving mother (Michelle Yeoh) taking aim. 
 
It soon becomes clear that the only thing crazier than love is family, in this funny and romantic story sure to ring true for audiences everywhere. 

“Crazy Rich Asians” features an international cast of stars, led by Constance Wu (“Fresh Off the Boat”), Gemma Chan (“Humans”), Lisa Lu (“2012”), and Awkwafina (“Ocean’s 8,” “Neighbors 2”), with Ken Jeong (the “Hangover” films”) and Michelle Yeoh (“Star Trek: Discovery,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”).  The large starring ensemble also includes Henry Golding, making his feature film debut, Sonoya Mizuno (“La La Land”), Chris Pang (“Marco Polo”), Jimmy O. Yang (“Silicon Valley”), comedian Ronny Chieng (“The Daily Show”), Remy Hii (“Marco Polo”), and Nico Santos (“Superstore”).   

Color Force’s Nina Jacobson (“The Hunger Games” films) and Brad Simpson (“World War Z”), and Ivanhoe Pictures’ John Penotti (“Hell or High Water”) produced the film, with executive producers Tim Coddington, Kevin Kwan, Robert Friedland, and Sidney Kimmel.  The screenplay is by Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim, based on the novel Crazy Rich Asians, by Kwan.

The creative filmmaking team included director of photography Vanja Černjul (“Marco Polo”), production designer Nelson Coates (“Fifty Shades Darker”), costume designer Mary Vogt (“Kong: Skull Island”) and editor Myron Kerstein (“Going in Style”).  The music was composed by Brian Tyler (“Avengers: Age of Ultron”).   

“Crazy Rich Asians” was filmed entirely on location in Singapore and Malaysia.  It is set for release on Wednesday, August 15, 2018.

Warner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with SK Global and Starlight Culture, a Color Force/Ivanhoe Pictures/Electric Somewhere Production, a Jon M. Chu Film, “Crazy Rich Asians.”  The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Entertainment Company.  It is rated PG-13.

Jason Statham (“Spy,” “Furious 7,” “The Expendables” films) and award-winning Chinese actress Li Bingbing (“Transformers: Age of Extinction,” “Forbidden Kingdom,” “The Message”) star in the science fiction action thriller “The Meg,” directed by Jon Turteltaub (the “National Treasure” movies, “Last Vegas”). 

In the film, a deep-sea submersible—part of an international undersea observation program—has been attacked by a massive creature, previously thought to be extinct, and now lies disabled at the bottom of the deepest trench in the Pacific…with its crew trapped inside.  With time running out, expert deep sea rescue diver Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is recruited by a visionary Chinese oceanographer (Winston Chao), against the wishes of his daughter Suyin (Li Bingbing), to save the crew—and the ocean itself—from this unstoppable threat: a pre-historic 75-foot-long shark known as the Megalodon.  What no one could have imagined is that, years before, Taylor had encountered this same terrifying creature.  Now, teamed with Suyin, he must confront his fears and risk his own life to save everyone trapped below…bringing him face to face once more with the greatest and largest predator of all time.

Rounding out the international main cast of “The Meg” are Rainn Wilson (TV’s “The Office,” “Super”), Ruby Rose (“xXx: Return of Xander Cage,” TV’s “Orange is the New Black”), Winston Chao (“Skiptrace,” “Kabali”), Page Kennedy (TV’s “Rush Hour”), Jessica McNamee (“The Vow,” TV’s “Sirens”), Ólafur Darri Ólafsson (“The BFG,” TV’s “The Missing”), Robert Taylor (“Focus,” TV’s “Longmire”), New Zealander Cliff Curtis (“The Dark Horse,” “Risen,” TV’s “Fear the Walking Dead”), Sophia Shuya Cai (“Somewhere Only We Know”), and Masi Oka (TV’s “Hawaii Five-0,” “Heroes”).

Turteltaub directed the film from a screenplay by Dean Georgaris and Jon Hoeber & Erich Hoeber, based on the New York Times best-selling novel by Steve Alten.  Lorenzo di Bonaventura (the “Transformers” films), Belle Avery (“Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead”) and Colin Wilson (“Suicide Squad,” “Avatar”) produced the film, with Gerald R. Molen, Randy Greenberg, Wayne Wei Jiang, and Barrie Osborne serving as executive producers.

Turteltaub’s behind-the-scenes team included Oscar-nominated director of photography Tom Stern (“Changeling,” “Sully,” “American Sniper,” “The Hunger Games”), Oscar-winning production designer Grant Major (“The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,” “X-Men- Apocalypse”), editor Steven Kemper (“Salt,” “Mission: Impossible II,” “Face/Off”) and costume designer Amanda Neale (“Truth,” “Pete’s Dragon,” “What We Do in the Shadows”).  

Filming on “The Meg” was accomplished on location in China and New Zealand. 

“The Meg” is a presentation of Warner Bros. Pictures and Gravity Pictures.  It is production of di Bonaventura Pictures, Apelles Entertainment, Maeday Productions, Inc., and Flagship Entertainment, in association with Beijing Digital Impression (BDI) Film, Inc.  
“The Meg” will be distributed in China by Gravity Pictures, and throughout the rest of the world by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Entertainment Company.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Previously thought to be extinct, a massive creature attacks a deep-sea submersible, leaving it disabled and trapping the crew at the bottom of the Pacific. With time running out, a visionary oceanographer recruits rescue diver Jonas Taylor to save the crew and the sea itself from an unimaginable threat -- a 75-foot-long prehistoric shark known as the Megalodon.

        “A Star is Born” stars four-time Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper (“American Sniper,” “American Hustle,” “Silver Linings Playbook”) and multiple award-winning, Oscar-nominated music superstar Lady Gaga, in her first leading role in a major motion picture. Cooper helms the drama, marking his directorial debut. 

 In this new take on the tragic love story, he plays seasoned musician Jackson Maine, who discovers—and falls in love with—struggling artist Ally (Gaga). She has just about given up on her dream to make it big as a singer... until Jack coaxes her into the spotlight. But even as Ally’s career takes off, the personal side of their relationship is breaking down, as Jack fights an ongoing battle with his own internal demons. 

 The cast of “A Star is Born” also includes Andrew Dice Clay, with Dave Chappelle and Sam Elliott. 

 In addition to playing Ally, Gaga, who earned her Oscar nod for the song “Til It Happens to You” from “The Hunting Ground,” performs original songs in the film, which she wrote with Cooper and a handful of artists, including Lukas Nelson, Jason Isbell and Mark Ronson. All the music is original and was recorded live. 

 “A Star is Born” is produced by Bill Gerber, Jon Peters, Bradley Cooper, Todd Phillips and Lynette Howell Taylor. Ravi Mehta, Basil Iwanyk, Niija Kuykendall, Sue Kroll, Michael Rapino and Heather Parry serve as executive producers. The screenplay is by Eric Roth and Bradley Cooper & Will Fetters. 

 Collaborating with Cooper behind the scenes are Oscar-nominated director of photography Matthew Libatique (“Black Swan”), production designer Karen Murphy, three-time Oscar-nominated editor Jay Cassidy (“American Hustle,” “Silver Linings Playbook,” “Into the Wild”), and costume designer Erin Benach. 

 Warner Bros. Pictures Presents, in Association with Live Nation Productions, in Association with Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures, A Jon Peters/Bill Gerber/Joint Effort Production, “A Star is Born.” Slated for release on October 5, 2018, the film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

Distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is intended to be the second film in Sony's Marvel Universe and the sequel to Venom (2018). The film is being directed by Andy Serkis from a screenplay by Kelly Marcel, and stars Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock / Venom alongside Woody Harrelson, Michelle Williams, Reid Scott, and Naomie Harris.

Plans for a sequel to Venom began during production on that film, with Harrelson cast to make a brief appearance as Cletus Kasady at the end of Venom with the intention of him playing the villain role in a potential sequel. Work began in January 2019, with Hardy and Harrelson confirmed to return along with Marcel as writer. Serkis was hired that August. Filming took place at Leavesden Studios in England from November 2019 to February 2020, with additional filming in San Francisco in February.

Venom 2 is set to be released in the United States on October 2, 2020.

In September 2019, Reid Scott was expected to reprise his role as Weying's boyfriend Dan from the first film. The character Shriek was also expected to appear as the film's secondary villain and a love interest for Carnage. Many different actresses were looked at for the part, before Naomie Harris was cast in the role in mid-October. Stephen Graham had also joined the film, in an undisclosed role, by the end of the year. Tolmach said there was a chance the sequel could be rated R following the success of the R-rated Joker (2019),Let There Be Carnage as well as previous successful R-rated comic book films such as Deadpool (2016) and Logan (2017). Venom 2, venom 2 trailer, venom 2 teaser, venom 2 official trailer. However, Tolmach cautioned that the PG-13 rating of the first Venom had led to box office success and they would not be looking to change the franchise's tone simply because it had worked for others. He added that the biggest lesson learned from the first Venom was that fans loved the relationship between Brock and Venom, and the sequel would focus more on the two characters together because of this.

Principal photography began on November 15, 2019, at Leavesden Studios in Hertfordshire, England under the working title Fillmore. Robert Richardson served as cinematographer for the film, reuniting with Serkis after they worked together on Breathe (2017). Filming took place at the campus of London South Bank University in mid-January 2020. Hardy revealed that filming in England was completed on February 8, with the production then moving to San Francisco where the film is set.

Filming also took place at the Palace of Fine Arts in the Marina District

Bohemian Rhapsody is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury.

The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to this day.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas Trailer - Directed by Ron Howard and starring Jim Carrey, Jeffrey Tambor, Bill Irwin, Clint Howard, Josh Ryan Evans. Inside a snowflake exists the magical land of Whoville. In Whoville, live the Who's, an almost mutated sort of munchkinlike people. All the Who's love Christmas, yet just outside of their beloved Whoville lives the Grinch. The Grinch is a nasty creature that hates Christmas, and plots to steal it away from the Whos which he equally abhors. Yet a small child, Cindy Lou Who, decides to try befriend the Grinch.

Life has become a balancing act for Adonis Creed. Between personal obligations and training for his next big fight, he is up against the challenge of his life. Facing an opponent with ties to his family’s past only intensifies his impending battle in the ring. Rocky Balboa is there by his side through it all and, together, Rocky and Adonis will confront their shared legacy, question what’s worth fighting for, and discover that nothing’s more important than family. Creed II is about going back to basics to rediscover what made you a champion in the first place, and remembering that, no matter where you go, you can’t escape your history.

Cast: Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Wood Harris, Russell Hornsby, Florian “Big Nasty” Munteanu, Andre Ward, Phylicia Rashad, Dolph Lundgren

Jamie Lee Curtis returns to her iconic role as Laurie Strode, who comes to her final confrontation with Michael Myers, the masked figure who has haunted her since she narrowly escaped his killing spree on Halloween night four decades ago. 
 
Master of horror John Carpenter executive produces and serves as creative consultant on this film, joining forces with cinema’s current leading producer of horror, Jason Blum (Get Out, Split, The Purge, Paranormal Activity).  Inspired by Carpenter’s classic, filmmakers David Gordon Green and Danny McBride crafted a story that carves a new path from the events in the landmark 1978 film, and Green also directs.

Halloween is also produced by Malek Akkad, whose Trancas International Films has produced the Halloween series since its inception, and Bill Block (Elysium, District 9).  In addition to Carpenter and Curtis, Green and McBride will executive produce under their Rough House Pictures banner.  Ryan Freimann also serves in that role.

Academy Award® nominee Viggo Mortensen (Eastern Promises, The Lord of the Rings trilogy) and Academy Award® winner Mahershala Ali (Moonlight, Hidden Figures) star in Participant Media and DreamWorks Pictures’ Green Book.  In his foray into powerfully dramatic work as a feature director, Peter Farrelly helms the film inspired by a true friendship that transcended race, class and the 1962 Mason-Dixon line.
 
When Tony Lip (Mortensen), a bouncer from an Italian-American neighborhood in the Bronx, is hired to drive Dr. Don Shirley (Ali), a world-class Black pianist, on a concert tour from Manhattan to the Deep South, they must rely on “The Green Book” to guide them to the few establishments that were then safe for African-Americans.  Confronted with racism, danger—as well as unexpected humanity and humor—they are forced to set aside differences to survive and thrive on the journey of a lifetime. 
 
Jim Burke (The Descendants), Charles B. Wessler (The Heartbreak Kid) produce alongside Farrelly’s fellow writers, Brian Currie and Nick Vallelonga, and Farrelly.  The drama is executive produced by Participant’s Jeff Skoll (The Help) and Jonathan King (Lincoln), along with Octavia Spencer (Fruitvale Station) and Kwame L. Parker (Kill Bill series), as well as Cinetic Media’s John Sloss (Boyhood) and Steven Farneth.  Linda Cardellini (Brokeback Mountain, The Founder) co-stars.

Spider-Man 3 is an upcoming superhero film, based on the Marvel Comics superhero of the same name. The film is a sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home. It is the twenty-seventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the fourth film of Phase Four. The film is set to be released on December 17, 2021.

──────────────────

Spider-Man Tom Holland Tobey Maguire Andrew Garfield Spider-Verse. Marvel's upcoming Spider-Man 3 could be the MCU's version of ""Spider-Verse,"" a classic comic book story that united the Spider-Man of different dimensions. 

The latest news regarding Spider-Man's final solo movie in the MCU is the most surprising. Jamie Foxx is returning as Electro in the Spider-Man franchise, reprising the role from Sony's The Amazing Spider-Man 2. While Marvel is hardly opposed to playing the nostalgia card, this is a film precious few look back on fondly. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone were effective, but the plot was over-cluttered, and Foxx was hardly given a chance to shine as the classic comic book villain.

Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) will serve as a “mentor” to Peter Parker in the third film, and there’s multitude of possibilities for the direction of Spidey’s third solo outing in the MCU. 

It’s possible that Electro crossing over the MCU world is just the beginning of the multiverse exploration, with the Sam Raimi helmed Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness doing the heavy lifting. But with the already existing threads connecting the web of MCU’s Spider-Man, including Vulture (Michael Keaton), Scorpion (Michael Mando), Kree and Skrulls hiding out on Earth, and the possibility for a crossover with Venom (Tom Hardy), Peter Parker may have enough on his plate at the moment. Doctor Strange and Electro’s inclusion in the third Spider-Man film may lay the groundwork for an eventual Spider-Verse event, but something tells me we’re getting a bit ahead of ourselves and the third Spider-Man film will be something more contained, though no less spectacular.

Marvel Phase 4 release dates for both the MCU movies and Disney Plus TV shows:

WandaVision (TBA 2020)
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (TBC 2021)
The Black Widow movie (May 7, 2021)
Shang-Chi: And the Legend of the Ten Rings (May 7, 2021)
Loki TV show (Spring 2021)
What If...? (Summer 2021)
Hawkeye series (Fall 2021)
Eternals (November 5, 2021)
Spider-Man 3 (December 17, 2021)
Thor: Love and Thunder (February 11, 2022)
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (March 25, 2022)

Vor Tausenden von Jahren verwüstete eine gewaltige Katastrophe die Erde, doch die Menschheit hat sich ihrer neuen Umgebung längst angepasst. Gigantische Metropolen auf Rädern erhoben sich aus den Trümmern der untergegangenen Zivilisation. Auf der Suche nach den letzten Ressourcen fahren sie über die verdörrte Steppe und verschlingen gnadenlos die kleineren Städte. Zu den großen Metropolen gehört auch London als einer der gewaltigsten rollenden Kolosse. In diesem unerbittlichen Kampf trifft der unscheinbare Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) in einer schicksalshaften Begegnung auf die gefährliche Flüchtige Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) – zwei Gegensätze prallen aufeinander, zwei Menschen, deren Wege einander nie hätten kreuzen sollen. Sie schmieden eine überraschende Allianz, die über den Fortgang der Menschheitsgeschichte bestimmen könnte.

N_QksSzK7sI,THE MULE - Official Trailer,Warner Bros. Pictures,UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g,"Nobody Runs Forever. Clint Eastwood is #TheMule, in theaters December 14.

http://www.facebook.com/TheMuleFilm/

http://www.themulefilm.com/

From Warner Bros. Pictures, Imperative Entertainment and BRON Creative comes Clint Eastwood’s newest feature film, the drama “The Mule.”  In addition to directing, the veteran actor will step in front of the lens again, alongside fellow stars Bradley Cooper, Laurence Fishburne, Michael Peña, Dianne Wiest and Andy Garcia, as well as Alison Eastwood, Taissa Farmiga, Ignacio Serricchio and Loren Dean, Eugene Cordero.

Eastwood stars as Earl Stone, a man in his 80s who is broke, alone, and facing foreclosure of his business when he is offered a job that simply requires him to drive.  Easy enough, but, unbeknownst to Earl, he’s just signed on as a drug courier for a Mexican cartel.  He does well—so well, in fact, that his cargo increases exponentially, and Earl is assigned a handler.  But he isn’t the only one keeping tabs on Earl; the mysterious new drug mule has also hit the radar of hard-charging DEA agent Colin Bates.  And even as his money problems become a thing of the past, Earl’s past mistakes start to weigh heavily on him, and it’s uncertain if he’ll have time to right those wrongs before law enforcement, or the cartel’s enforcers, catch up to him.

“The Mule” marks Oscar-winner Eastwood’s first time on both sides of the camera since he starred in 2009’s critically acclaimed “Gran Torino.”

Cooper, who stars as Bates, received his most recent Oscar nominations for his work with Eastwood, acting in and producing “American Sniper”; he will next be seen in his feature directorial debut, “A Star Is Born.”  Oscar nominee Fishburne (“What’s Love Got to Do with It,” TV’s “Black-ish”) plays a DEA special agent in charge; Peña (upcoming “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” Netflix’s “Narcos”) plays a fellow agent; Oscar winner Wiest (“Bullets Over Broadway,” “Hannah and Her Sisters,” TV’s “Life in Pieces”) plays Earl’s ex-wife; Oscar nominee Garcia (“The Godfather: Part III”) plays a cartel boss; Alison Eastwood (“Rails & Ties”) plays Earl’s daughter; Farmiga (“The Nun”) plays the role of Earl’s granddaughter; Serricchio (Netflix’s “Lost in Space,” “The Wedding Ringer”) plays Earl’s cartel handler; Dean (“Space Cowboys”) plays another agent; and Cordero (“Kong: Skull Island”) plays a cartel member.

Clint Eastwood (“Sully,” “American Sniper”) directed from a screenplay by Nick Schenk (“Gran Torino”), inspired by the New York Times Magazine article “The Sinaloa Cartels’ 90-Year-Old Drug Mule” by Sam Dolnick.  Eastwood also produced the film under his Malpaso banner, along with Tim Moore, Kristina Rivera and Jessica Meier, and Imperative Entertainment’s Dan Friedkin and Bradley Thomas.  The film’s executive producers are Dave Bernad, Ruben Fleischer, Todd Hoffman and Aaron Gilbert.  Jillian Apfelbaum and David M. Bernstein co-produced.

Eastwood’s team behind the scenes includes director of photography Yves Bélanger (“Brooklyn,” “Dallas Buyers Club”) and production designer Kevin Ishioka (“The 15:17 to Paris”), along with longtime costume designer Deborah Hopper and Oscar-winning editor Joel Cox (“Unforgiven”), who have worked with Eastwood throughout the years on numerous projects.

The Mule Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Hugo Weaving, Angus Sampson Crime Movie HD

Inspired by true events, The Mule tells the story of a naive man who is detained by federal police with lethal narcotics hidden in his stomach. Alone and afraid, ‘the Mule’ makes a desperate choice; to defy his bodily functions and withhold the evidence… literally. By doing so he becomes a 'human time bomb'; dragging cops, criminals and concerned family into his impossible escapade.

From DreamWorks Animation comes a surprising tale about growing up, finding the courage to face the unknown…and how nothing can ever train you to let go.  What began as an unlikely friendship between an adolescent Viking and a fearsome Night Fury dragon has become an epic adventure spanning their lives.  Welcome to the most astonishing chapter of one of the most beloved animated franchises in film history: How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.  

Now chief and ruler of Berk alongside Astrid, Hiccup has created a gloriously chaotic dragon utopia.  When the sudden appearance of female Light Fury coincides with the darkest threat their village has ever faced, Hiccup and Toothless must leave the only home they’ve known and journey to a hidden world thought only to exist in myth.  As their true destines are revealed, dragon and rider will fight together—to the very ends of the Earth—to protect everything they’ve grown to treasure.

For How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, series director Dean DeBlois returns alongside the all-star cast.  The film is produced by Brad Lewis (Ratatouille, ANTZ) and Bonnie Arnold (Toy Story, How to Train Your Dragon,How to Train Your Dragon 2).

https://www.GlassMovie.com

M. Night Shyamalan brings together the narratives of two of his standout originals—2000’s Unbreakable, from Touchstone, and 2016’s Split, from Universal—in one explosive, all-new comic-book thriller: Glass.  

From Unbreakable, Bruce Willis returns as David Dunn as does Samuel L. Jackson as Elijah Price, known also by his pseudonym Mr. Glass.  Joining from Split are James McAvoy, reprising his role as Kevin Wendell Crumb and the multiple identities who reside within, and Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke, the only captive to survive an encounter with The Beast.  
 
Following the conclusion of Split, Glass finds Dunn pursuing Crumb’s superhuman figure of The Beast in a series of escalating encounters, while the shadowy presence of Price emerges as an orchestrator who holds secrets critical to both men.

Joining the all-star cast are Unbreakable’s Spencer Treat Clark and Charlayne Woodard, who reprise their roles as Dunn’s son and Price’s mother, as well as Golden Globe Award winner Sarah Paulson (American Horror Story series).
 
This riveting culmination of his worldwide blockbusters is produced by Shyamalan and Blumhouse Production’s Jason Blum, who also produced the writer/director’s previous two films for Universal.  They produce again with Ashwin Rajan and Marc Bienstock, and Steven Schneider and Kevin Frakes, who executive produce.  Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum also serve as executive producers.

A Blinding Edge Pictures and Blumhouse production, Glass will be released by Universal Pictures in North America on January 18, 2019, and by Buena Vista International abroad.

From visionary filmmakers James Cameron (AVATAR) and Robert Rodriguez (SIN CITY), comes ALITA: BATTLE ANGEL, an epic adventure of hope and empowerment. When Alita (Rosa Salazar) awakens with no memory of who she is in a future world she does not recognize, she is taken in by Ido (Christoph Waltz), a compassionate doctor who realizes that somewhere in this abandoned cyborg shell is the heart and soul of a young woman with an extraordinary past. As Alita learns to navigate her new life and the treacherous streets of Iron City, Ido tries to shield her from her mysterious history while her street-smart new friend Hugo (Keean Johnson) offers instead to help trigger her memories. But it is only when the deadly and corrupt forces that run the city come after Alita that she discovers a clue to her past – she has unique fighting abilities that those in power will stop at nothing to control. If she can stay out of their grasp, she could be the key to saving her friends, her family and the world she’s grown to love.

Kristen quiere celebrar su 30 cumpleaños de una forma especial y decide invitar a su novio, Tyler, y a sus cuatro amigos a una Escape Room, un juego que consiste en intentar escapar de una habitación resolviendo pruebas y acertijos en una hora. 
Lo que parecía algo divertido y diferente se convierte en una pesadilla para el grupo de amigos al percatarse que, poco a poco, las pruebas se complican de tal forma que se convierte en un juego mortal, en el que la habitación reclama una nueva víctima cada vez. Ahora ya no están jugando a un simple pasatiempo, están jugándose la vida.

After sending shockwaves across contemporary culture and setting a new standard for provocative, socially-conscious horror films with his directorial debut, Get Out, Academy Award®-winning visionary Jordan Peele returns with another original nightmare that he has written, directed and produced.

Set in present day along the iconic Northern California coastline, Us, from Monkeypaw Productions, stars Oscar® winner Lupita Nyong’o as Adelaide Wilson, a woman returning to her beachside childhood home with her husband, Gabe (Black Panther’s Winston Duke), and their two children (Shahadi Wright Joseph, Evan Alex) for an idyllic summer getaway. 

Haunted by an unexplainable and unresolved trauma from her past and compounded by a string of eerie coincidences, Adelaide feels her paranoia elevate to high-alert as she grows increasingly certain that something bad is going to befall her family.

After spending a tense beach day with their friends, the Tylers (Emmy winner Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker, Cali Sheldon, Noelle Sheldon), Adelaide and her family return to their vacation home. When darkness falls, the Wilsons discover the silhouette of four figures holding hands as they stand in the driveway. Us pits an endearing American family against a terrifying and uncanny opponent: doppelgängers of themselves. 

Writer and director Peele produces for his Monkeypaw Productions alongside Sean McKittrick, Jason Blum, and Monkeypaw’s Ian Cooper. Us will be released by Universal Pictures on Friday, March 22, 2019.",2018-12-25T14:00:08Z,[],30501871,292506,12508,33036,458723,0.44669811320754715

From Disney and visionary director Tim Burton, “Dumbo” expands on the beloved classic story where differences are celebrated, family is cherished and dreams take flight.

Circus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito) enlists former star Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) and his children Milly (Nico Parker) and Joe (Finley Hobbins) to care for a newborn elephant whose oversized ears make him a laughingstock in an already struggling circus. But when they discover that Dumbo can fly, the circus makes an incredible comeback, attracting persuasive entrepreneur V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton), who recruits the peculiar pachyderm for his newest, larger-than-life entertainment venture, Dreamland. Dumbo soars to new heights alongside a charming and spectacular aerial artist, Colette Marchant (Eva Green), until Holt learns that beneath its shiny veneer, Dreamland is full of dark secrets.

With Jean spiraling out of control, and hurting the ones she loves most, she begins to unravel the very fabric that holds the X-Men together. Now, with this family falling apart, they must find a way to unite -- not only to save Jean's soul, but to save our very planet from aliens who wish to weaponize this force and rule the galaxy.

The world of Pokémon comes to life!

The first-ever live-action Pokémon movie, “POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” stars Ryan Reynolds as the titular character in the first-ever live-action movie based on the iconic face of the global Pokémon brand—one of the world’s most popular, multi-generation entertainment properties and most successful media franchises of all time.

Fans everywhere can now experience Pikachu on the big screen as never before, as a talking detective Pikachu, a Pokémon like no other. The film also showcases a wide array of beloved Pokémon characters, each with its own unique abilities and personality.

The story begins when ace private eye Harry Goodman goes mysteriously missing, prompting his 21-year-old son Tim to find out what happened. Aiding in the investigation is Harry’s former Pokémon partner, Detective Pikachu: a hilariously wise-cracking, adorable super-sleuth who is a puzzlement even to himself. Finding that they are uniquely equipped to communicate with one another, Tim and Pikachu join forces on a thrilling adventure to unravel the tangled mystery. Chasing clues together through the neon-lit streets of Ryme City—a sprawling, modern metropolis where humans and Pokémon live side by side in a hyper-realistic live-action world—they encounter a diverse cast of Pokémon characters and uncover a shocking plot that could destroy this peaceful co-existence and threaten the whole Pokémon universe.

“POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” also stars Justice Smith (“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”) as Tim; Kathryn Newton (“Lady Bird,” TV’s “Big Little Lies”) as Lucy, a junior reporter following her first big story; and Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe (“Godzilla,” “The Last Samurai”) as Lt. Yoshida.

Directed by Rob Letterman (“Goosebumps,” “Monsters Vs. Aliens”), the “POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” creative filmmaking team includes two-time Oscar nominated director of photography John Mathieson (“The Phantom of the Opera,” “Gladiator”), production designer Nigel Phelps (“Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Lies”) and Oscar-winning editor Mark Sanger (“Gravity”). Visual effects are by Moving Picture Company (“Wonder Woman”) and Framestore (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”).

Launched in 1996 to overwhelming response, the Pokémon brand is a global sensation that now encompasses a robust video gaming fandom with over 300 million units sold worldwide; the Pokémon Trading Card Game available in 11 languages with more than 23.6 billion cards shipped; an animated television series in its 21st season that is available in more than 160 countries; and over 20 animated films; as well as books, manga comics, music, toys, merchandise, and apps, including the wildly popular Pokémon GO, that has been downloaded over 850 million times and is enjoyed across the globe by fans of all ages.

“POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” is set for release on Friday, May 10, 2019.

The film will be distributed outside of Japan and China by Warner Bros.
