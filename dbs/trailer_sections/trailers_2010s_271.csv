RoboCop TRAILER 1 (2014) - Samuel L. Jackson, Abbie Cornish Movie HD


Robocop gets rebooted in this big-screen MGM production from director José Padilha. The picture will once again surround a slain police officer (played by The Killing's Joel Kinnaman) who gets resurrected as a crime-fighting cyborg until memories of his previous life begin to make him doubt his corrupt corporate overlords. Gary Oldman co-stars as the doctor who suffers a crisis-of-conscience after bringing life back to the man in the form of a mechanical body and reprogrammed brain, while Samuel L. Jackson plays a larger-than-life media mogul.",2013-09-05T23:25:45Z,"['movieclips', 'movie clips', 'movieclipstrailers', 'new trailers', 'trailers HD', 'hd', 'trailers', 'movieclipsDOTcom', 'trailer', '2013', 'official', 'HD', 'zefr', 'robocop trailer', 'robocop', 'robots', 'gary oldman', 'michael keaton', 'José Padilha', 'Douglas Urbanski', 'abbie cornish', 'Jay Baruchel', 'Joel Kinnaman', 'samuel l. jackson', 'etimmons', '2014', 'police', 'cop']",4131023,15477,1449,2988,97020,0.18621399176954734

Sinopsis: Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) es un veterano agente del servicio aéreo de los Marshals ya un tanto quemado tanto con el mundo como con su profesión: Él no considera su cometido como un deber con el que salvaguardar vidas, sino como un simple trabajo de escritorio... pero en el cielo. Sin embargo, el vuelo de hoy no será un viaje de rutina. Pronto en el viaje transatlántico desde Nueva York a Londres recibe una serie de misteriosos mensajes de texto ordenándole de que inste al gobierno a hacer una transferencia de 150 millones de dólares a una cuenta secreta, o un pasajero morirá cada 20 minutos.

Preview of the exclusive content from the Amazing Spider-Man 2 Target Exclusive Bonus disc.

It's great to be Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). For Peter Parker, there's no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen (Emma Stone). But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: OsCorp.

But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: OsCorp.

Genre: Action / Adventure / Fantasy
Cast: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx

Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) is the foremost researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence, working to create a sentient machine that combines the collective intelligence of everything ever known with the full range of human emotions. His highly controversial experiments have made him famous, but they have also made him the prime target of anti-technology extremists who will do whatever it takes to stop him. However, in their attempt to destroy Will, they inadvertently become the catalyst for him to succeed—to be a participant in his own transcendence. For his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and best friend Max Waters (Paul Bettany), both fellow researchers, the question is not if they can...but if they should.  Their worst fears are realized as Will's thirst for knowledge evolves into a seemingly omnipresent quest for power, to what end is unknown. The only thing that is becoming terrifyingly clear is there may be no way to stop him.

Sinopsis: El Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) es el investigador más importante en el campo de la Inteligencia Artificial, trabajando en la creación de una máquina sensitiva que combine la inteligencia colectiva de todo lo conocido con el rango completo de emociones humanas. Sus experimentos altamente controvertidos le han hecho famoso, pero al mismo tiempo le han convertido en el principal objetivo de extremistas anti-tecnológicos que, en su intento de destruir a Will, se convertirán inadvertidamente en los catalizadores de su éxito haciéndole partícipe de su propia trascendencia. Para su mujer Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) y su mejor amigo Max Waters (Paul Bettany), ambos compañeros de investigación, la cuestión no es si pueden hacerlo... sino si deben hacerlo. Los peores miedos de Evelyn y Max se hacen realidad cuando la sed de conocimiento de Will evoluciona en una omnipresente búsqueda de poder de consecuencias desconocidas. Lo único que se vuelve terroríficamente incuestionable es que puede no haber modo de detenerle.

Pompeii Official Teaser Trailer #1 (2014) - Kit Harington, Paul W.S. Anderson Movie HD

It's late summer in 79 A.D. and the city of Pompeii glitters at the foot of the mighty Mt. Vesuvius. MILO, the slave of a shipping tycoon, dreams of the day he will buy his freedom and marry his master's daughter, COLUMBA. What he doesn't know is that Columba's debt-ridden father has promised Columba to a despicable Roman Senator to pay off an overdue loan.

Milo does know that his friend, the Gladiator NIGELLUS, is being forced to compete the next day in a seemingly unwinnable battle in the Coliseum. As Milo tries to find a way to save his friend, he learns that Columba has been promised to another man and that he himself has been sold to a new master. Just as it seems things can't get any worse, Mt. Vesuvius suddenly explodes with the power of 40 nuclear bombs, sending a torrent of 1,000-degree ash and smoke into the city. Lava flows down the mountainside, killing thousands. As Pompeii crumbles, Nigellus is imprisoned inside the Coliseum, Columba is locked inside her family's villa, and Milo is trapped aboard a ship bound for Naples.

As the people of Pompeii flee the obliterated city, Milo is determined to return to it to save his friend and his beloved Columba. With fire and ash destroying the only world he's ever known, an ordinary man is tested to his breaking point in this heart-pounding tale of extraordinary heroism.

X2i9Zz_AqTg,Neighbors 2 - Official Trailer (HD),Universal Pictures,UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw,"Returning stars Seth Rogen, Zac Efron and Rose Byrne are joined by Chloë Grace Moretz for Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, the follow-up to 2014’s most popular original comedy.  Nicholas Stoller again directs in a film that follows what happens when the will of parenthood goes against the bonds of sisterhood. 

Now that Mac (Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Byrne) have a second baby on the way, they are ready to make the final move into adulthood: the suburbs.  But just as they thought they’d reclaimed the neighborhood and were safe to sell, they learn that the new occupants next door are a sorority even more out of control than Teddy (Efron) and his brothers ever dreamed of being.

Tired of their school’s sexist, restrictive system, the unorthodox ladies of Kappa Nu have decided to start a house where they can do whatever the hell they want.  When Shelby (Moretz) and her sisters, Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein), find the perfect place just off campus, they won’t let the fact that it’s located on a quiet street stand in their way of parties as epic as the guys throw.

Forced to turn to the one ex-neighbor with the skills to bring down the new Greeks next door, the Radners—alongside best friends Jimmy (Ike Barinholtz) and Paula (Carla Gallo)—bring in charismatic Teddy as their secret weapon.  If he can infiltrate the sorority and charm his way through it, the thirtysomethings will shutter the Kappas’ home.  But if they think that their neighbors are going down without a fight, they have severely underestimated the power of youthful ingenuity and straight-up crazy.

From Disney comes ""Maleficent""—the untold story of Disney's most iconic villain from the 1959 classic ""Sleeping Beauty."" A beautiful, pure-hearted young woman, Maleficent has an idyllic life growing up in a peaceable forest kingdom, until one day when an invading army threatens the harmony of the land. Maleficent rises to be the land's fiercest protector, but she ultimately suffers a ruthless betrayal—an act that begins to turn her pure heart to stone. Bent on revenge, Maleficent faces an epic battle with the invading king's successor and, as a result, places a curse upon his newborn infant Aurora. As the child grows, Maleficent realizes that Aurora holds the key to peace in the kingdom—and perhaps to Maleficent's true happiness as well.

The film stars Angelina Jolie as Maleficent, Sharlto Copley, Elle Fanning, Sam Riley, Imelda Staunton, Juno Temple and Lesley Manville.

""Maleficent"" is produced by Joe Roth and directed by Robert Stromberg, with Angelina Jolie, Don Hahn, Matt Smith, Palak Patel and Sarah Bradshaw serving as executive producers. Linda Woolverton wrote the screenplay.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) waits for his girlfriend Ruth (Sarah Silverman) to finish work at the whorehouse so they can go on a date.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Seth MacFarlane plays a hapless farmhand in the Old West who loses his girl when he ducks out of a fight, only to be taught how to shoot by the wife of an infamous gunfighter in this Media Rights Capitol Western comedy. The setting is Arizona, circa 1882. In the wake of talking his way out of a showdown in the streets of Old Stump, cowardly sheepherder Albert (MacFarlane) is unceremoniously dumped by his beloved girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried). Meanwhile, on the outskirts of town, notorious outlaw Clinch (Liam Neeson) prepares for a big holdup, instructing his wife Anna (Charlize Theron) and sidekick Lewis (Evan Jones) to pose as a pair of sibling farmers in Old Stump and await his return. When Lewis starts a bar brawl, Albert instinctively gets Anna out of harm's way and a friendship begins to blossom. Later, Anna poses as Albert's girlfriend at a fair in order to make Louise jealous, but it all goes awry when Albert and Louise's new beau Foy (Neal Patrick Harris), the owner of the local ""Moustachery,"" end up challenging one another to draw in front of the entire town. Now there's only one problem: Albert has never even so much as fired a gun. Fortunately, as the wife of a notorious outlaw, Anna knows her way around a pistol, and with just one week to go before the big showdown, she offers to give Albert a crash course in marksmanship. With the help of his sexy, straight-shooting teacher, Albert not only manages to hit a can or two, but to summon some inner courage as well. He'll need all he can get, too, because when Clinch gets word that his wife is being romanced by one of the locals, he rides into town with revenge on his mind and a loaded six-shooter on his hip.

The epic action of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" unfolds in a near future in which an alien race has hit the Earth in an unrelenting assault, unbeatable by any military unit in the world.  

Major William Cage (Cruise) is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission.  Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop—forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again...and again.

scfHbf5dWok,Edge of Tomorrow trailer but it's CoD: Advanced Warfare,AUBY,UCUt-UClRZF2k-GT0nkjXuKw,"Call of Duty gets its new game: ...Advanced Warfare of Tomorrow? Edge of Advanced Warfare...? Advanced Edge of Tomorrow Warfare...? Something along those lines. I'm really excited about the release of CoD: AW, so here's a fan-made mash-up.

Enjoy an epic trailer mash-up of two Sci-Fi blockbuster productions full of explosions, exoskeletons and more explosions. 

This was quite difficult to do, since the game hasn't released yet so I had no scenes of the characters actually talking at all. This was the best I could do, given the circumstances. Hope you all enjoyed!

Up next is a Halo/Elysium trailer mash-up, which worked out very well. Stay subscribed for more awesome mash-ups.

In einer nicht allzu weit entfernten Zukunft beginnt eine bienenähnliche Alienrasse -- die sogenannten Mimics -- damit, die Erde zu invadieren. In unerbittlichen Angriffen legen sie ganze Städte in Schutt und Asche und lassen nichts als Tod und Verderben zurück. Keine Armee der Welt vermag die zerstörerische Kraft aufzuhalten. Die Menschheit ist technologisch weit unterlegen und scheint dem Untergang geweiht. Doch noch hat sie nicht alle Hoffnung verloren. Die militärischen Kräfte der ganzen Welt haben sich verbündet, um in einer letzten Offensive gegen das übermächtige Alienheer in die Schlacht zu ziehen. Es ist ein reines Selbstmordkommando. Diesem kann auch der degradierte Lt. Col. Bill Cage (Tom Cruise) nicht entgehen. Er stirbt während des Kampfes, aber unglaublicherweise erwacht er daraufhin wieder am Morgen desselben Tages. Doch dann geht es nicht einfach weiter, er steckt in einer Zeitschleife fest, die ihn denselben Tag immer und immer wieder erleben lässt. Je häufiger er ihn durchlebt, umso besser werden seine Fertigkeiten als Kämpfer. Schon bald kämpft er Seite an Seite mit Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) von den Spezialkräften und beginnt neue Hoffnung zu schöpfen. Möglicherweise lässt sich die Erde am Ende doch noch retten...

After making their way through high school (twice), big changes are in store for officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) when they go deep undercover at a local college. But when Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football team, and Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene, they begin to question their partnership. Now they don't have to just crack the case - they have to figure out if they can have a mature relationship. If these two overgrown adolescents can grow from freshmen into real men, college might be the best thing that ever happened to them.

In The Equalizer, Denzel Washington plays McCall, a man who believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and dedicated himself to beginning a new, quiet life. But when McCall meets Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz), a young girl under the control of ultra-violent Russian gangsters, he can't stand idly by -- he has to help her. Armed with hidden skills that allow him to serve vengeance against anyone who would brutalize the helpless, McCall comes out of his self-imposed retirement and finds his desire for justice reawakened.

Y0oX0xiwOv8,Boyhood | Official US Trailer | IFC Films,IFC Films,UCOn923UnbV8H9zo_lO6ZCRw,"Boyhood is nominated for a total of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Ethan Hawke), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Patricia Arquette), Best Director (Richard Linklater), Best Film Editing (Sandra Adair) and Best Original Screenplay (Richard Linklater). 

Boyhood is the Golden Globe Award Winner for Best Picture, Drama and Patricia Arquette is the Golden Globe Award Winner for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture and Richard Linklater is the Golden Globe Award Winner for Best Director.

http://www.boyhoodmovie.com 

Filmed over 12 years with the same cast, Richard Linklater's BOYHOOD is a groundbreaking story of growing up as seen through the eyes of a child named Mason (a breakthrough performance by Ellar Coltrane), who literally grows up on screen before our eyes. Starring Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette as Mason's parents and newcomer Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha, BOYHOOD charts the rocky terrain of childhood like no other film has before. Snapshots of adolescence from road trips and family dinners to birthdays and graduations and all the moments in between become transcendent, set to a soundtrack spanning the years from Coldplay's Yellow to Arcade Fire's Deep Blue. BOYHOOD is both a nostalgic time capsule of the recent past and an ode to growing up and parenting. It's impossible to watch Mason and his family without thinking about our own journey.

Music: Family of the Year ""Hero""

Estreno: 26 de Septiembre 2014
BOYHOOD (MOMENTOS DE UNA VIDA), de Richard Linklater, es un drama de ficción rodado con el mismo grupo de actores durante doce años, concretamente desde 2002 a 2013, que trata de un viaje tan épico como íntimo a través de la euforia de la niñez, los sísmicos cambios de una familia moderna y el paso del tiempo.
La película sigue a Mason (ELLAR COLTRANE) desde los seis años durante algo más de una década poblada de cambios, mudanzas y controversias, relaciones que se tambalean, bodas, diferentes colegios, primeros amores, primeras desilusiones, momentos maravillosos, momentos de miedo y una constante mezcla de desgarro y de sorpresa. Los resultados son totalmente impredecibles, ya que cada momento lleva a otro, uniéndose en la profunda experiencia personal que nos forma mientras crecemos y nos acoplamos a la siempre cambiante naturaleza de nuestra vida.
La historia empieza cuando Mason, un soñador de seis años, se enfrenta a la primera gran convulsión de su vida: su entregada y luchadora madre Olivia (PATRICA ARQUETTE) ha decidido que se muda con Mason y su hermana Samantha (LORELEI LINKLATER) a Houston, justo cuando el padre de sus hijos, Mason Sr (ETHAN HAWKE) acaba de regresar a Alaska. Así empieza una vida de cambios. Entre una marea de padres y padrastros, novias, profesores, jefes, peligros, deseos y pasión creativa, Mason consigue encontrar su propio camino.

Vor 12 Jahren, im Jahr 2002, hatte Regisseur Richard Linklater die Idee, einen Film über die Kindheit zu drehen. Dafür wählte er ein einzigartiges cineastisches Experiment: Von 2002 bis 2013 begleitete er den sechsjährigen Mason (Ellar Coltrane) bis zum Eintritt ins College. Kurze, über die Jahre verteilte Episoden aus dem Leben von Mason und seiner Patchwork-Familie -- seine zwei Jahre ältere Schwester (Lorelei Linklater) und seine ge-schiedenen Eltern (Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke) -- montierte Linklater zu einer berüh-renden Coming-of-Age-Geschichte.

Mit seinem neuesten Film, gefeiert beim Sundance Festival und bei den Berliner Filmfest-spielen, setzt er hiermit einen filmischen Meilenstein.
BOYHOOD zeichnet ein emotional tief berührendes Porträt der Jugend mit all ihren Hö-hen und Tiefen. Eine Hymne an das Leben voller erzählerischer Kraft und Leichtigkeit.

Bei den diesjährigen Berliner Filmfestspielen wurde BOYHOOD mit den Silbernen Bären für die Beste Regie ausgezeichnet und erhielt den Preis für den besten Film des Wettbe-werbs von der Jury der AG Kino -- Gilde deutscher Filmkunsttheater.",2014-05-16T10:10:46Z,"['Boyhood', 'Richard Linklater']",1781,0,0,0,85350,0.20490196078431375

Ein warmer Sommermorgen in Missouri: Nick (Ben Affleck) und Amy (Rosamund Pike) sollten heute eigentlich ihren fünften Hochzeitstag feiern, doch Amy ist plötzlich verschwunden. Als sie nicht wieder auftaucht, gerät Nick in das Visier der Polizei. Nick ist verwirrt, denn nachts suchen ihn schreckliche Träume heim, in denen er Amy tötet. Nick besteht jedoch auf seine Unschuld, verstrickt sich jedoch in ein Netz aus Lügen und Verrat. Doch auch Amys Weste ist nicht so rein wie angenommen. Durch den Fund ihres Tagebuchs kommen Dinge ans Licht, die niemand jemals von der vermeintlich perfekten Frau erwartet hätte. Doch noch immer ist unsicher, ob Amy überhaupt noch am Leben ist.

Jay (Jason Segel) and Annie (Cameron Diaz) are a married couple still very much in love, but ten years and two kids have cooled the passion.  To get it back, they decide – why not? – to make a video of themselves trying out every position in THE JOY OF SEX in one marathon three-hour session.  It seems like a great idea, until they discover that their most private video has gone public.  In a panic, they begin a wild night of adventure – tracking down leads, roping in friends, duping Annie’s boss – all to reclaim their video, their reputation, their sanity, and, most importantly, their marriage.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
A married couple embark on a mad dash to recover their sex tape after it goes viral in this Sony Pictures comedy from director Jake Kasdan (Bad Teacher, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story). Their once-scorching sex lives doused by a decade of marriage and two kids, Jay (Jason Segel) and Annie (Cameron Diaz) were only trying to recapture a little of that pre-marriage passion when they decided to fire up the video camera, and try every position in The Joy of Sex. Later, they are terrified by the realization that their intimate video has been uploaded to the cloud, and synched to the iPads they gave their family and friends for Christmas. Now, in order to save their reputations and avoid some serious embarrassment, Jay and Annie race around town on a madcap mission to collect each iPad. Unfortunately for them, the cloud works in mysterious ways. Rob Corddry, Ellie Kemper, and Rob Lowe co-star.

A vengeful father comes to the aid of a mother, her teenage daughter, and a defenseless young couple on the one night of the year that all crime, including murder, is legal in this self-contained sequel from co-producer Jason Blum and original Purge writer/director James DeMonaco. As the countdown to the Purge starts ticking, struggling waitress Eva (Carmen Ejogo) risks her safety by staying late at work to ask her boss for a raise. Later, as she returns home to her elderly father (John Beasley) and daughter Cali (Zo Soul), bickering couple Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) attempt to make their way out of the city following a frightening run-in with a gang of masked, machete-wielding thugs. While these five people are eager to seek sanctuary from the impending wave of violence about to flood the streets, a lone stranger (Frank Grillo) intent on seeking vengeance for the wrongful death of his son plans to draw blood from the man responsible. Armed to the teeth as he cruises the city in a modified muscle car, he gets sidetracked from his mission when he sees Eva and Cali fighting for their lives against a small army of black-clad soldiers. Against his better judgment, he rescues the pair, only realizing later that Shane and Liz also jumped into his backseat in order to escape a gang that disabled their car and were hunting them through the streets. When the stranger's car is similarly damaged beyond the point of repair, this unlikely group must stick together in order to survive the night. But little do they realize that their nightmare has only just begun.

But this prince, Hercules, knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time. The story behind one of the greatest myths is revealed in this action-packed epic - a tale of love, sacrifice and the strength of the human spirit.

Synopsis: Hercules, the mighty son of Zeus and Hera, is taken from his Mount Olympus home and raised on Earth. The fiery figure behind Hercules’s disappearance is Hades, the hot-headed god of the Underworld who has grown tired of looking after a “bunch of deadbeats” and sees Zeus’s son as an obstacle to his plans to take over Olympus. Hades sends his two dim-witted sidekicks, Pain and Panic, to abduct Hercules, though they bungle their mission by not administering the final drop of a potent potion, which leaves the infant with god-like strength but human mortality. As Hercules grows up, he discovers the truth about his origins and sets out to prove himself a true hero (with the help of a veteran hero-training satyr named Philoctetes) so he can return to Olympus. Hades has other plans and tries to kill him by arranging a catalogue of calamities (a multiheaded Hydra, a Minotaur, a Cyclops, an army of Titans, and the traitorous damsel-in-distress, Megara). Along the way, Hercules discovers that a true hero is not measured by the size of his strength but the strength of his heart. 

Cast: Tate Donovan (adult Hercules), Danny DeVito (Phil),  Susan Egan (Megara), James Woods (Hades), Charlton Heston (opening narrator), Matt Frewer (Panic), Bobcat Goldthwait (Pain), Paul Shaffer (Hermes), Rip Torn (Zeus), Samantha Eggar (Hera), Joshua Keaton (teen Hercules speaking), Roger Bart (teen Hercules singing), Hal Holbrook (Amphitryon), Barbara Barrie (Alcmene). 

Songs: “The Gospel Truth,” “Go the Distance,” “One Last Hope,” “Zero to Hero,” “I Won’t Say (I’m in Love)” “A Star is Born,” 

Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements. 

General release on June 27, 1997, after a June 14 premiere at the New Amsterdam Theater in New York City, and a limited release beginning there the next day. 

US Home Media Releases: February 3, 1998 (VHS); October 7, 1998 (DVD); November 9, 1999 (DVD); August 1, 2000 (DVD/VHS); August 12, 2014 (BR/DVD);  

Trivia:
• Musker and Clements were attracted by the mythological aspects of the Hercules story, and decided to produce the film, along with Alice Dewey, in the fall of 1993. Over the next nine months, the two collaborated on an outline, several treatments, and eventually an initial script, aided by art director Andy Gaskill, who oversaw the visual development on the film. 
• British artist/political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, with a bold, expressive linear style, was brought in to assist with character design, and he remained involved as an ongoing artistic adviser to the animators. 
• A field trip to Greece and Turkey in the summer of 1994 gave artists a firsthand look at landscapes and ancient sites, and an opportunity to hear expert accounts of classic Greek mythology. 
• Animation began in early 1995, and eventually a team of nearly 700 artists were involved with the project. 
• The film features the first use in animation of the process of morphing, wherein an object is made to smoothly transform into another, utilizing computer technology.",2014-09-09T14:21:57Z,"['Disney', 'Hercules', 'Megara', 'Hades', 'Phil', 'Pegasus', 'Pain', 'Panic', 'Zeus', 'Danny DeVito', 'Tate Donovan', 'Susan Egan', 'James Woods', 'Charlton Heston', 'Bobcat Goldthwait', 'Matt Frewer', 'John Musker', 'Ron Clements']",220975,0,0,0,184315,0.2016088486676722

Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) wurde unter freiem Nachthimmel geboren, bereits bei ihrer Geburt gab es erste Anzeichen, das Jupiter etwas ganz besonderes und zu außergewöhnlichen Dingen berufen ist. Als junge Erwachsene träumt Jupiter von den Sternen, muss sich aber mit der harten und kalten Realität anfreunden. Sie hat bereits einige Trennungen hinter sich und lebt momentan von ihrem Job als Putzfrau auch mehr schlecht als recht.
Doch als Caine (Channing Tatum), ein genetisch veränderter Ex-Söldner, auf der Erde ankommt um Jupiter zu finden, bekommt die junge Frau einen ersten Eindruck davon, was das Schicksal für sie bereithält. Sie stammt aus einer Blutlinie, die dazu in der Lage ist, das Gleichgewicht im Universum wiederherzustellen.

U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle is sent to Iraq with only one mission: to protect his brothers-in-arms.  His pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and, as stories of his courageous exploits spread, he earns the nickname “Legend.”  However, his reputation is also growing behind enemy lines, putting a price on his head and making him a prime target of insurgents.  He is also facing a different kind of battle on the home front: striving to be a good husband and father from halfway around the world.  

Despite the danger, as well as the toll on his family at home, Chris serves through four harrowing tours of duty in Iraq, personifying the spirit of the SEAL creed to “leave no one behind.”  But upon returning to his wife, Taya Renae Kyle (Sienna Miller), and kids, Chris finds that it is the war he can’t leave behind.  

A two-time Oscar nominee for his work in “Silver Linings Playbook” and “American Hustle,” Cooper heads the cast, which also includes Sienna Miller (HBO’s “The Girl”), Jake McDorman, Luke Grimes, Navid Negahban and Keir O’Donnell. 

Oscar-winning filmmaker Clint Eastwood (“Million Dollar Baby,” “Unforgiven”) is directing “American Sniper” from a screenplay written by Jason Hall, based on the book by Chris Kyle, with Scott McEwan and Jim DeFelice. The autobiography was a runaway bestseller, spending 18 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, 13 of those at number one.  

The film is being produced by Eastwood, Robert Lorenz, Andrew Lazar, Bradley Cooper and Peter Morgan.  Tim Moore, Jason Hall, Sheroum Kim and Bruce Berman are serving as executive producers.

The behind-the-scenes creative team includes Oscar-nominated director of photography Tom Stern (“Changeling”); Oscar-nominated production designer James J. Murakami (“Changeling”) and production designer Charisse Cardenas; Oscar-winning editor Joel Cox (“Unforgiven”) and editor Gary D. Roach; and costume designer Deborah Hopper.

She terrified you in “The Conjuring,” but this is where it all began for Annabelle.

Capable of unspeakable evil, the actual doll exists locked up in an occult museum in Connecticut—visited only by a priest who blesses her twice a month.

New Line Cinema’s supernatural thriller “Annabelle” begins before the evil was unleashed.

John Form has found the perfect gift for his expectant wife, Mia—a beautiful, rare vintage doll in a pure white wedding dress.  But Mia’s delight with Annabelle doesn’t last long.  

On one horrific night, their home is invaded by members of a satanic cult, who violently attack the couple.  Spilled blood and terror are not all they leave behind.  The cultists have conjured an entity so malevolent that nothing they did will compare to the sinister conduit to the damned that is now...Annabelle.

Director: John Leonetti
Cast: Annabelle Wallis, Alfre Woodard, Ward Horton, Tony Amendola, Eric Ladin, Brian Howe
Producers: Peter Safran, Joan Mao, James Wan

     “Annabelle Comes Home” is the third installment of New Line Cinema’s hugely successful “Annabelle” films starring the infamous sinister doll from the “Conjuring” universe.  Gary Dauberman, the screenwriter of the “Annabelle” films, “IT” and “The Nun,” makes his directorial debut on the film, which is produced by Peter Safran (“Aquaman”), who has produced all the films in the “Conjuring” franchise, and “Conjuring” universe creator James Wan (“Aquaman”).
     Determined to keep Annabelle from wreaking more havoc, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren bring the possessed doll to the locked artifacts room in their home, placing her “safely” behind sacred glass and enlisting a priest’s holy blessing.  But an unholy night of horror awaits as Annabelle awakens the evil spirits in the room, who all set their sights on a new target—the Warrens’ ten-year-old daughter, Judy, and her friends.
     The film stars McKenna Grace (TV’s “The Haunting of Hill House,” “Gifted,” “Captain Marvel”) as Judy; Madison Iseman (“Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” “Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween”) as her babysitter, Mary Ellen; and Katie Sarife (TV’s “Youth and Consequences” and “Supernatural”) as troubled friend Daniela; with Patrick Wilson (“Aquaman,” “The Conjuring” and “Insidious” films) and Vera Farmiga (“The Conjuring” films, upcoming “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” TV’s “Bates Motel”) reprising their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren. 
     Dauberman directed the film from a screenplay he wrote, from a story by Dauberman & Wan.  Richard Brener, Dave Neustadter, Victoria Palmeri, Michael Clear, Michelle Morrissey and Judson Scott served as executive producers.
     Dauberman’s behind-the-scenes team included director of photography Michael Burgess (upcoming “The Curse of La Llorona”), production designer Jennifer Spence (“Annabelle: Creation,” “The Nun”), editor Kirk Morri (“Aquaman”) and costume designer Leah Butler (“Annabelle: Creation”).

Tratto dal racconto “Tutti voi zombie” del 1959 di Robert A. Heinlein, il film racconta la vita di un singolare agente, magistralmente interpretato da Ethan Hawke (Nomination all’Oscar® come Miglior Attore Non Protagonista per Boyhood), che deve affrontare una serie intricata di viaggi spazio temporali, progettati per garantire l’applicazione della legge per l’eternità. Ora,
al suo ultimo incarico, l'agente è all’inseguimento di un criminale che da sempre continua a sfuggirgli: l’obiettivo è salvare migliaia di vite messe in pericolo dai piani di questo terribile
assassino.

Flatmates Viago (#TaikaWaititi), Deacon (Jonny Brugh), and Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) are three vampires who are just trying to get by in modern society; from paying rent and sticking to the housework roster to trying to get invited in to nightclubs, they're just like anyone else - except they're immortal and must feast on human blood.

When their 8000 year-old flatmate Petyr, turns 20-something human hipster Nick, into a vampire, the guys must teach him the ropes and guide him through his new found eternal life. And in return they are forced to learn a thing or two about modern society, fashions, technology, and the internet. But it's the introduction of Nick's human friend, Stu, that really changes the vampire's lives and attitudes towards the ever-changing world around them.

When Stu's life is threatened, the vamps show us that maybe humans are worth fighting for, and that even though your heart may be cold and dead, it doesn't mean you can't feel anything. #WhatWeDoInTheShadows

What We Do in the Shadows Official Trailer 2 (2014) - Vampire Mocumentary HD

WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS
In theaters February 13, 2015
----------------------------
Starring: Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi, Rhys Darby, Jonathan Brugh, Cori Gonzalez-Macuer, Stu Rutherford, and Jackie Van Beek
Directed by: Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi
Written by: Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi 
---------------------------
Synopsis
WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS chronicles the adventures of four vampire roommates trying to get by in a modern world that's not always hospitable to the undead. Clement and Waititi, creators of the HBO hit series ""Flight of the Conchords,"" co-wrote, co-directed, and co-star in this hilarious send-up in which an endearingly unhip quartet of friends reveal to us or, rather, to the documentary crew that's filming them, the details of their daily-make that nightly-routine.  Ranging in age from 183 to 8,000, and in appearance from adorably youthful to Nosferatu-crusty, they squabble over household chores, struggle to keep up with the latest trends in technology and fashion, antagonize the local werewolves, cruise clubs for lovely ladies, and deal with the rigors of living on a very, very strict diet.  The film also stars Rhys Darby, Jonathan Brugh, Cori Gonzalez-Macuer, Stu Rutherford, and Jackie Van Beek, and was produced by Waititi, Chelsea Winstanley and Emanuel Michael.",2014-12-05T17:31:35Z,"['movieclips', 'movie clips', 'movieclipstrailers', 'new trailers', 'trailers HD', 'hd', 'trailers', 'movieclipsDOTcom', 'trailer', '2014', 'official', 'HD', 'zefr', 'indie', 'independent', 'film festival', 'What We Do in the Shadows', 'What We Do in the Shadows movie', 'What We Do in the Shadows trailer', 'vampire', 'mockumentary', 'faux documentary', 'horror', 'comedy', 'Taika Waititi', 'Jemaine Clement', 'Jonathan Brugh']",501048,2066,49,99,246741,0.35384615384615387

https://www.facebook.com/MadMaxMovie

From director George Miller, originator of the post-apocalyptic genre and mastermind behind the legendary “Mad Max” franchise, comes “Mad Max: Fury Road,” a return to the world of the Road Warrior, Max Rockatansky. 

Haunted by his turbulent past, Mad Max believes the best way to survive is to wander alone.  Nevertheless, he becomes swept up with a group fleeing across the Wasteland in a War Rig driven by an elite Imperator, Furiosa.  They are escaping a Citadel tyrannized by the Immortan Joe, from whom something irreplaceable has been taken.  Enraged, the Warlord marshals all his gangs and pursues the rebels ruthlessly in the high-octane Road War that follows.

Tom Hardy (“The Dark Knight Rises”) stars in the title role in “Mad Max: Fury Road”—the fourth in the franchise’s history.  Oscar winner Charlize Theron (“Monster,” “Prometheus”) stars as the Imperator, Furiosa.  The film also stars Nicholas Hoult (“X-Men: Days of Future Past”) as Nux; Hugh Keays-Byrne (“Mad Max,” “Sleeping Beauty”) as Immortan Joe; and Nathan Jones (“Conan the Barbarian”) as Rictus Erectus.  Collectively known as The Wives, Zoë Kravitz (“Divergent”) plays Toast, Riley Keough (“Magic Mike”) is Capable, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (“Transformers: Dark of the Moon”) is Splendid, and supermodel Abbey Lee is The Dag, and Courtney Eaton is Fragile.  Also featured in the movie are Josh Helman as Slit, Jennifer Hagan as Miss Giddy, and singer/songwriter/performer iOTA as Coma-Doof Warrior.

The cast is rounded out by well-known Australian actors John Howard and Richard Carter, supermodel Megan Gale, Angus Sampson, Joy Smithers, Gillian Jones, Melissa Jaffer and Melita Jurisic.

Oscar-winning filmmaker George Miller (“Happy Feet”) is directing the film from a screenplay he wrote with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris.  Miller is also producing the film, along with longtime producing partner, Oscar nominee Doug Mitchell (“Babe”, “Happy Feet”), and P.J. Voeten.  Iain Smith, Graham Burke and Bruce Berman serve as executive producers.

The behind-the-scenes creative team includes Oscar-winning director of photography John Seale (“The English Patient”), production designer Colin Gibson (“Babe”), editor Margaret Sixel (“Happy Feet”), Oscar-winning costume designer Jenny Beavan (“A Room with a View”), action unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris (“Australia”), and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt (“Knowing”).

Warner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Kennedy Miller Mitchell production, a George Miller film, “Mad Max: Fury Road.”  The film is scheduled for release on May 15, 2015, and will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.

Nightcrawler Teaser Trailer #1 (2014) - Jake Gyllenhaal Movie HD

NIGHTCRAWLER is a pulse-pounding thriller set in the nocturnal underbelly of contemporary Los Angeles. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Lou Bloom, a driven young man desperate for work who discovers the high-speed world of L.A. crime journalism. Finding a group of freelance camera crews who film crashes, fires, murder and other mayhem, Lou muscles into the cut-throat, dangerous realm of nightcrawling -- where each police siren wail equals a possible windfall and victims are converted into dollars and cents. Aided by Rene Russo as Nina, a veteran of the blood-sport that is local TV news, Lou thrives. In the breakneck, ceaseless search for footage, he becomes the star of his own story.

When a failed assassination attempt occurs on the President's (Cotter Smith) life by the teleporting mutant Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), it's Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his School for Gifted Youngsters who are targeted for the crime. While Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Storm (Halle Berry) try and locate the assassin, Cyclops (James Marsden) and Xavier (also known as 'Professor X') seek answers from their old foe Magneto (Ian McKellan) in his glass cell...Little do they know they're walking into a trap set by the villainous William Stryker (Brian Cox), a mysterious governmental figure that figures into Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) secretive past, along with information about the X-Men's operation, supplied by Magneto through a mind-controlling agent. Meanwhile Wolverine, just home from a failed mission to regain his memory, is in charge of the students when a crack-commando team led by Stryker infiltrates the school by order of the President. With a mansion full of young, powerful mutants and the ferocious Wolverine in babysitter mode, can he defend the school against the one man who can answer his questions? What roles do the sinister Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) and Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) have in all of this? Why does Stryker want Professor X and his Cerebro machine? With the war between humanity and mutants escalating to extremes, can the rest of the X-Men trust their old foes to help them? Director Bryan Singer returns and raises the stakes in this sequel to the highly lauded 2000 adaptation of Marvel Comics' X-Men.

Sinopsis: Durante el invierno de 1952, las autoridades británicas entraron en el hogar del matemático, analista y héroe de guerra Alan Turing, con la intención de investigar la denuncia de un robo. Acabaron arrestando a Turing acusándole de indecencia grave, un cargo que le supondría a una devastadora condena por, lo que en aquel entonces se consideraba una ofensa criminal, ser homosexual. Los oficiales no tenían ni idea de que en realidad estaban incriminando al pionero de la informática actual. Liderando a un heterogéneo grupo de académicos, lingüistas, campeones de ajedrez y oficiales de inteligencia, se le conoce por haber descifrado el código de la inquebrantable máquina Enigma de los alemanes durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial.

THE IMITATION GAME è una rappresentazione incredibile della vita e dell'opera di Alan Turing, uno dei più straordinari eroi non riconosciuti della Gran Bretagna. 
Durante l'inverno del 1952, le autorità britanniche entrarono nella casa del matematico, criptoanalista ed eroe di guerra Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) per indagare su una segnalazione di furto con scasso. Finirono invece per arrestare lo stesso Turing con l'accusa di “atti osceni”, incriminazione che lo avrebbe portato alla devastante condanna per il reato di omosessualità. Le autorità non sapevano che stavano arrestando il pioniere della moderna informatica. Noto leader di un gruppo eterogeneo di studiosi, linguisti, campioni di scacchi e agenti dei servizi segreti, ha avuto il merito di aver decifrato i cosiddetti codici indecifrabili della macchina tedesca Enigma durante la II Guerra Mondiale. Ritratto intenso e inquietante di un brillante e complesso uomo, THE IMITATION GAME mostra un genio che sotto una pressione angosciante ha contribuito a ridurre la durata della guerra e, quindi, a salvare milioni di vite. Diretto da Morten Tyldum sulla sceneggiatura di Graham Moore, il film è interpretato da Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, Allen Leech, Matthew Beard, Charles Dance e Mark Strong.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Harry (Jeff Daniels) visits his ill friend Lloyd (Jim Carrey) who has been playing a prank on him for 20 years.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels reprise their roles as lovable imbeciles Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne in this sequel to Dumb and Dumber from original directing duo Bobby and Peter Farrelly. The movie revisits the titular duo of dumb Harry (Daniels) and dumber Lloyd (Carrey), 20 years after the events of the first film: Harry pays his first visit to his parents since the early '90s, and discovers a two-decade-old postcard from a gal he hooked up with (Kathleen Turner) informing him that she's pregnant. It turns out she had a daughter and put the girl up for adoption. Harry is moved by the prospect of having an adult child out there somewhere (and it just so happens that he needs a kidney transplant), so he and Lloyd embark on a road trip to track down his daughter. They get mixed up in many wacky situations along the way, like finding and stealing their old ""Shaggin' Wagon,"" and being duped into pleasuring an old lady in exchange for her hearing aids.

The Theory of Everything is the story of the most brilliant and celebrated physicist of our time, Stephen Hawking, and Jane Wilde the arts student he fell in love with whilst studying at Cambridge in the 1960s.  
 
Little was expected from Stephen Hawking, a bright but shiftless student of cosmology, given just two years to live following the diagnosis of a fatal illness at 21 years of age.  He became galvanized, however, by the love of fellow Cambridge student, Jane Wilde, and he went on to be called the successor to Einstein, as well as a husband and father to their three children.  Over the course of their marriage as Stephen’s body collapsed and his academic renown soared, fault lines were exposed that tested the lineaments of their relationship and dramatically altered the course of both of their lives.

---
Oscar winner Ron Howard (“A Beautiful Mind”) directs the action adventure “In the Heart of the Sea,” based on Nathaniel Philbrick’s best-selling book about the dramatic true journey of the Essex.

In the winter of 1820, the New England whaling ship Essex was assaulted by something no one could believe: a whale of mammoth size and will, and an almost human sense of vengeance.  The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick.  But that told only half the story.  

“In the Heart of the Sea” reveals the encounter’s harrowing aftermath, as the ship’s surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive.  Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down.

“In the Heart of the Sea” stars Chris Hemsworth (“The Avengers,” “Rush”) as the vessel’s veteran first mate Owen Chase; Benjamin Walker (“Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter”) as its inexperienced Captain, George Pollard; Cillian Murphy (“The Dark Knight Rises”) as second mate Matthew Joy; and Ben Whishaw (“Skyfall”) as novelist Herman Melville, whose inquiries into the event 30 years later helped bring the story to light. 

Tom Holland (“The Impossible”) also stars as young seaman Tom Nickerson, and Brendan Gleeson (“Edge of Tomorrow”) as the same man, 30 years later.  Spanish actor Jordi Mollà (“Riddick”) is the captain of another ship, the Archimedes, who tries to warn the Essex of what may lie ahead.

Howard directed from a screenplay by Charles Leavitt (“Blood Diamond”), story by Charles Leavitt and Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver (“Rise of the Planet of the Apes”), based on the book In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex by Nathaniel Philbrick, winner of the 2000 National Book Award for Nonfiction.

The film is produced by Joe Roth (“Oz the Great and Powerful”), Paula Weinstein (“Blood Diamond,” “This is Where I Leave You”), Will Ward, Brian Grazer (“J. Edgar”) and Ron Howard.  Serving as executive producers are Bruce Berman, Sarah Bradshaw, Palak Patel, Erica Huggins and David Bergstein, with William M. Connor as co-producer.

The behind-the-scenes creative team includes Oscar-winning director of photography Anthony Dod Mantle (“Slumdog Millionaire,” “Rush”); production designer Mark Tildesley (“The Fifth Estate”); Oscar-winning editors Michael Hill (“Apollo 13,” “Rush”) and Dan Hanley (“Apollo 13”); costume designer Julian Day (“Rush”) and composer Roque Baños (“Evil Dead”).

“In the Heart of the Sea” is a Warner Bros. Pictures presentation, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a COTT Productions-Enelmar Productions, A.I.E. co-production, a Roth Films/Spring Creek/Imagine Entertainment Production, in Association with Kia Jam.  

Opening in December, 2015 in theaters and IMAX, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros.

It’s been four years since theme park and luxury resort Jurassic World was destroyed by dinosaurs out of containment.  Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles.

When the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event.  Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission.  Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.

With all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before.  Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.  

Stars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.  They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles.

#JurassicWorldDominion is an upcoming American science fiction adventure film directed by Colin Trevorrow. A sequel to the 2018 film Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, it is the sixth film in the Jurassic Park franchise and the final film in the Jurassic World trilogy.

──────────────────

Anyone who saw Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was treated to an ending with pretty big implications. Dinosaurs are on the loose in the mainland.

As with its predecessors, Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley will produce the film, with Trevorrow and Jurassic Park (1993) director Steven Spielberg acting as executive producers. It stars an ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Jake Johnson, Omar Sy, Daniella Pineda, Justice Smith, Isabella Sermon and BD Wong reprising their roles from previous films in the franchise.

Jurassic World: Dominion will mark the first time since the original Jurassic Park that Sam Neil, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum reprised their original roles together in a Jurassic Park movie. Dominion also marks twenty years since Neil and Dern reprised their roles as Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler in film.

Howard has been talking about how the movie will ""bring the entire saga together"", especially as it's been reported that it's the final movie in the Jurassic World series. Chris Pratt has promised fans that they ""will not be disappointed"" and teased that the movie could start after a time jump.

While there are a lot of questions that are left open at the end of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, we're not sure which ones would be a priority when it comes to providing any answers in Jurassic Park 3's story. However, it can be assumed that this third, and possibly final, film in the Jurassic World franchise deals with rounding up the surviving dinosaurs scattered across the world.

Jurassic World: Dominion is slated to hit theaters June 11, 2021.

Are you excited?

1FJD7jZqZEk,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom - Final Trailer [HD],Universal Pictures,UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw,"It’s been three years since theme park and luxury resort Jurassic World was destroyed by dinosaurs out of containment.  Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles.

When the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event.  Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission.  Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.

With all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before.  Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.  

Stars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.  They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles.

Directed by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible), the epic action-adventure is written by Jurassic World’s director, Trevorrow, and its co-writer, Derek Connolly.  Producers Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley once again partner with Spielberg and Trevorrow in leading the filmmakers for this stunning installment.  Belén Atienza joins the team as a producer.

Zunächst versucht die anerkannte Sprachwissenschaftlerin Dr. Alice Howland (Julianne Moore) noch, ihre Krankheit zu verheimlichen. Gelegentliche Orientierungslosigkeit in den Straßen von Manhattan und Schwierigkeiten, einzelne Wörter zu finden, machen das Leben zwar zunehmend schwerer, doch erst als sie anfängt, auch Menschen zu verwechseln, spricht sie mit ihrer Familie. Ihr liebender Ehemann John (Alec Baldwin) ist genauso schockiert wie es ihre drei erwachsenen Kinder Anna (Kate Bosworth), Tom (Hunter Parrish) und Lydia (Kristen Stewart) sind, als sie erfahren, dass Alice an einer seltenen Form von Alzheimer leidet, die auch vererbbar ist. Mit der Diagnose wird das bislang so perfekt geglaubte Familien- und Alltagsleben, an dem Alice mit allen Mitteln festhalten will, auf eine äußerst harte Probe gestellt…

Paddington (gesprochen von Colin Firth) wuchs tief im peruanischen Dschungel bei seiner Tante Lucy auf. Da Lucy früher einmal die Gelegenheit hatte, einen englischen Abenteurer kennenzulernen, hat sie ihren Neffen auf ganz eigenwillige Weise herangezogen: Sie lehrte ihn, Marmelade zu kochen, dem BBC World Service zu lauschen und schwärmte von einem aufregenden Leben in London.

Paddington ha crecido en las profundidades de la selva peruana junto a su tía Lucy quien, debido a un encuentro casual con un explorador inglés, ha inculcado en su sobrino el sueño de vivir una vida emocionante en Londres. Después de que un terremoto destruya su hogar, la tía Lucy decide ocultar a su joven sobrino en un barco rumbo a Inglaterra en busca de una vida mejor.
Cuando el pequeño llega solo a la estación de Paddington, se da cuenta de que la vida de la ciudad no tiene nada que ver con lo que se había imaginado, hasta que conoce a los Brown, una bondadosa familia que se lo encuentra con una etiqueta alrededor del cuello en la que se puede leer: 'Por favor, cuidad de este oso. Gracias'. Los Brown le acogen en su casa mientras Paddington busca al famoso explorador que dejó marcada a su tía Lucy muchos años atrás.
Sin embargo, poco después, una siniestra y atractiva taxidermista se fija en él, lo que supone una amenaza para su hogar y para su propia vida.
PADDINGTON reúne a un elenco estelar encabezado por Hugh Bonneville (Downtown Abbey, Monuments Men) y Sally Hawkins (Pago justo, Blue Jasmine), en el papel del Sr. y la Sra. Brown respectivamente, Nicole Kidman (Las horas, Moulin Rouge), quien interpreta a la malvada taxidermista, Julie Walters (Billy Elliot, Harry Potter), en el papel de la Sra. Bird, la sirvienta, Jim Broadbent (Harry Potter, La dama de hierro), actor que encarna al Sr. Gruber, el propietario de la tienda de antigüedades, y Peter Capaldi (Doctor Who), en el papel del Sr. Curry, vecino de los Brown.
En palabras de David Heyman: ""Ha sido un gran honor tener la oportunidad de llevar a la gran pantalla al famoso personaje de Michael Bond. Estoy encantado de poder trabajar con Paul King, el director perfecto, pues su imaginación, su estilo, su prodigio y su ingenio son incomparables. Asimismo, también estoy muy contento de que este maravilloso reparto me haya ayudado a que la historia del oso Paddington cobrara vida"".

http://www.thehobbit.com

From Academy Award®-winning filmmaker Peter Jackson comes “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,” the third in a trilogy of films adapting the enduringly popular masterpiece The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien.  

“The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies” brings to an epic conclusion the adventures of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakenshield and the Company of Dwarves.  Having reclaimed their homeland from the Dragon Smaug, the Company has unwittingly unleashed a deadly force into the world.  Enraged, Smaug rains his fiery wrath down upon the defenseless men, women and children of Lake-town.  

Obsessed above all else with his reclaimed treasure, Thorin sacrifices friendship and honor to hoard it as Bilbo’s frantic attempts to make him see reason drive the Hobbit towards a desperate and dangerous choice.  But there are even greater dangers ahead.  Unseen by any but the Wizard Gandalf, the great enemy Sauron has sent forth legions of Orcs in a stealth attack upon the Lonely Mountain.  

As darkness converges on their escalating conflict, the races of Dwarves, Elves and Men must decide – unite or be destroyed.  Bilbo finds himself fighting for his life and the lives of his friends in the epic Battle of the Five Armies, as the future of Middle-earth hangs in the balance.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Watanabe (Miyavi) forces Louis (Jack O'Connell) to run a foot race.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Angelina Jolie directs this true-life tale of Louis Zamperini, the Olympic track star who survived a plane crash in World War II, only to fight for his life against nature and eventually as a prisoner of war. Joel and Ethan Coen provide the script. Louis (Jack O'Connell) grows up a rough-hewn kid on the verge of becoming a full-on delinquent, until his brother starts training him to be a track star. Louis excels at the sport, and eventually represents America at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. During his training, he learns to become resilient and disciplined; his brother's words of advice, ""If you can take it, you can make it,"" push him to overcome any adversity. He must live up to that adage under the most extreme circumstances after his plane is shot down during another bombing raid. He is stranded at sea for more than a month, only to be found by the Japanese and forced to endure constant physical abuse at the hands of sadistic prison-camp guard Mutsuhiro Watanabe (Japanese pop star Miyavi), who wants to break Louis' indomitable spirit.

BIG EYES is based on the true story of Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz), who was one of the most successful painters of the 1950s and early 1960s. The artist earned staggering notoriety by revolutionizing the commercialization and accessibility of popular art with his enigmatic paintings of waifs with big eyes. The truth would eventually be discovered though: Keane’s art was actually not created by him at all, but by his wife, Margaret (Amy Adams). The Keanes, it seemed, had been living a lie that had grown to gigantic proportions. BIG EYES centers on Margaret’s awakening as an artist, the phenomenal success of her paintings, and her tumultuous relationship with her husband, who was catapulted to international fame while taking credit for her work.

Sinopsis: Basada en la historia real de Walter Keane, uno de los pintores más exitosos de los años 50 y principios de los 60. El artista alcanzó una notoriedad asombrosa al revolucionar la comercialización y accesibilidad del arte popular con sus enigmáticas pinturas de niños abandonados con grandes ojos. Sin embargo, la verdad terminaría saliendo a la luz: la obra de Keane no fue creada por él, sino por su esposa, Margaret. Al parecer, los Keane vivieron una mentira que fue creciendo hasta alcanzar proporciones gigantescas. 'Big eyes' se centra en el despertar de Margaret como artista, en el fenomenal éxito de sus pinturas y la tumultuosa relación que mantuvo con su marido, catapultado a la fama mundial mientras se llevaba todo el crédito por el trabajo de Margaret.

Del director Neill Blomkamp, responsable de películas con un enfoque único como 'District 9' y 'Elysium', llega 'Chappie'. Coescrita por Teri Tatchel esta su nueva aventura en el mundo de la ciencia-ficción.

Ambientada en Johanesburgo, y con un personaje robótico ridículo como protagonista, este delirante relato nos traslada a un viaje por las emociones y sentimientos en un mundo distinto a la par que sorprendente. Con un argumento elaborado y un trasfondo reflexivo, esta cómica historia encaja en un marco inusual visualmente cuidado e impactante. Una comedia que cala por la simplicidad de su trama principal, y engancha por los minuciosos detalles que te adentran en una realidad ficticia y muy visual. Enigmática y divertida a partes iguales, se trata de una historia de corazón en un entorno robotizado y futurista donde la ciencia ficción es el paisaje.

Este es el caso de Chappie, un niño dotado, especial.. un prodigio. Como todo niño Chappie vivirá bajo las influencias de su entorno - algunas buenas y otras malas - y dependerá de su corazón y su alma para encontrar su camino en el mundo y hacerse hombre. Pero hay algo que diferencia a Chappie de todos los demás: es un robot. El primer robot con la capacidad de pensar y sentir por sí mismo. Esta es una idea peligrosa  y supone un reto que lo enfrentará a fuerzas oscuras y poderosas que no pararán hasta acabar con los de su clase.

A medida que la amenaza crece, Jay y sus amigos deben escapar de alguna manera del terror que les sigue los pasos.

Die 19-Jährige Jay (Maika Monroe) hat Sex mit Hugh (Jake Weary), ihrem Date. Doch hätte sie vorher gewusst, was der Beischlaf für Folgen haben wird, wäre sie nicht zu dem jungen Mann auf den Rücksitz geklettert. Als sie, noch benommen vom Chloroform und an einen Stuhl gefesselt, wieder aufwacht, erklärt ihr Jay reumütig, dass er einen verstörenden Hintergedanken hatte: Er sei von einem Geist verfolgt worden, den er loswerden und zu diesem Zweck transferieren wollte – ein Ziel, dass er mit dem Sex erreicht habe. Jay glaubt Hugh zunächst nicht, sieht den Geist aber bald mit eigenen Augen, er hat sich in unterschiedlichen Erscheinungen an ihre Fersen geheftet: als nackte Frau, großer Mann und kleines Kind. Um ihn loszuwerden, müsse Jay mit einer anderen Person schlafen. Ob der heimgesuchten jungen Frau ein anderer Ausweg gelingt? Verzweifelt bittet sie ihre Schwester Kelly (Lili Sepe) und ihre Freunde Yara (Olivia Lucardi) und Paul (Keir Gilchrist) um Hilfe…

https://www.facebook.com/MadMaxMovie

From director George Miller, originator of the post-apocalyptic genre and mastermind behind the legendary “Mad Max” franchise, comes “Mad Max: Fury Road,” a return to the world of the Road Warrior, Max Rockatansky. 

Haunted by his turbulent past, Mad Max believes the best way to survive is to wander alone.  Nevertheless, he becomes swept up with a group fleeing across the Wasteland in a War Rig driven by an elite Imperator, Furiosa.  They are escaping a Citadel tyrannized by the Immortan Joe, from whom something irreplaceable has been taken.  Enraged, the Warlord marshals all his gangs and pursues the rebels ruthlessly in the high-octane Road War that follows.

Tom Hardy (“The Dark Knight Rises”) stars in the title role in “Mad Max: Fury Road”—the fourth in the franchise’s history.  Oscar winner Charlize Theron (“Monster,” “Prometheus”) stars as the Imperator, Furiosa.  The film also stars Nicholas Hoult (“X-Men: Days of Future Past”) as Nux; Hugh Keays-Byrne (“Mad Max,” “Sleeping Beauty”) as Immortan Joe; and Nathan Jones (“Conan the Barbarian”) as Rictus Erectus.  Collectively known as The Wives, Zoë Kravitz (“Divergent”) plays Toast, Riley Keough (“Magic Mike”) is Capable, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (“Transformers: Dark of the Moon”) is Splendid, and supermodel Abbey Lee is The Dag, and Courtney Eaton is Fragile.  Also featured in the movie are Josh Helman as Slit, Jennifer Hagan as Miss Giddy, and singer/songwriter/performer iOTA as Coma-Doof Warrior.

The cast is rounded out by well-known Australian actors John Howard and Richard Carter, supermodel Megan Gale, Angus Sampson, Joy Smithers, Gillian Jones, Melissa Jaffer and Melita Jurisic.

Oscar-winning filmmaker George Miller (“Happy Feet”) is directing the film from a screenplay he wrote with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris.  Miller is also producing the film, along with longtime producing partner, Oscar nominee Doug Mitchell (“Babe”, “Happy Feet”), and P.J. Voeten.  Iain Smith, Graham Burke and Bruce Berman serve as executive producers.

The behind-the-scenes creative team includes Oscar-winning director of photography John Seale (“The English Patient”), production designer Colin Gibson (“Babe”), editor Margaret Sixel (“Happy Feet”), Oscar-winning costume designer Jenny Beavan (“A Room with a View”), action unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris (“Australia”), and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt (“Knowing”).

Warner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Kennedy Miller Mitchell production, a George Miller film, “Mad Max: Fury Road.”  The film is scheduled for release on May 15, 2015, and will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.

So begins a spectacular saga of power and sacrifice in which war has many faces, and everyone fights for something.

Johnny Depp returns to the big screen as the iconic, swashbuckling anti-hero Jack Sparrow in the all-new “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.” The rip-roaring adventure finds down-on-his-luck Captain Jack feeling the winds of ill-fortune blowing strongly his way when deadly ghost sailors, led by the terrifying Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), escape from the Devil's Triangle bent on killing every pirate at sea—notably Jack. Jack's only hope of survival lies in the legendary Trident of Poseidon, but to find it he must forge an uneasy alliance with Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), a brilliant and beautiful astronomer, and Henry (Brenton Thwaites), a headstrong young sailor in the Royal Navy. At the helm of the Dying Gull, his pitifully small and shabby ship, Captain Jack seeks not only to reverse his recent spate of ill fortune, but to save his very life from the most formidable and malicious foe he has ever faced. 

“Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” also stars Kevin R. McNally as Joshamee Gibbs,  Golshifteh Farahani as the sea-witch Shansa, Stephen Graham as Scrum, David Wenham as Scarfield and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa.

Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg are directing “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” with Jerry Bruckheimer producing. The executive producers are Mike Stenson, Chad Oman, Joe Caracciolo, Jr. and Brigham Taylor. Jeff Nathanson wrote the screenplay. “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” drops anchor in U.S. theaters on May 26, 2017.

Black Panther is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Jack Kirby, first appearing in Fantastic Four #52 (cover-dated July 1966) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Black Panther's real name is T'Challa, king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies. Black Panther, Black Panther 2, Black Panther 2 trailer, Black Panther 2 official trailer, Black Panther 2 movie, Black Panther 2 teaser trailer. Black Panther is the first superhero of African descent in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early black superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the Falcon (1969), Luke Cage (1972) and Blade (1973) or DC Comics' John Stewart in the role of Green Lantern (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by Kasper Cole, a multiracial New York City police officer. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T'Challa.
