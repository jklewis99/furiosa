PERCY JACKSON & THE LIGHTNING THIEF, van de maker van Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone en The Chamber of Secrets, speelt zich af in een hedendaagse wereld waar ook de twaalf Griekse Goden van de berg Olympus leven. Deze goden hebben een nieuw ras van jonge, mythische helden gecreëerd, die halfgoden zijn  voor de helft sterfelijk, voor de helft god. 
 
Percy (Logan Lerman) is zo'n halfgod en de zoon van de god Poseidon. Hij wordt er door Zeus (Sean Bean) - de broer van Poseidon - van verdacht zijn bliksemschicht te hebben gestolen, het machtigste wapen van het hele universum. Percy gaat op een avontuurlijke en gevaarlijke missie om zijn onschuld te bewijzen en een vernietigende oorlog tussen de goden te voorkomen.
 
Tijdens zijn tocht gaat hij de strijd aan met machtige vijanden die vastbesloten zijn hem tegen te houden. Ook leidt zijn tocht hem naar de onderwereld waar hij zijn moeder uit de dodelijke klauwen van zijn vaders grootste vijand: Hades (de god van de onderwereld) moet zien te redden. De rol van Medusa wordt vertolkt door Uma Thurman en Pierce Brosnan speelt Chiron, een belangrijk sleutelfiguur voor Percy en zijn missie.
 
PERCY JACKSON & THE LIGHTNING THIEF is gebaseerd op het eerste boek van de succesvolle Amerikaanse bestseller-reeks PERCY JACKSON.

Στην άδειά του επισκέπτεται τον πατέρα του στη Νότια Καρολίνα. Η Σαβάνα Κέρτις (Αμάντα Σάιφριντ), μια πανέμορφη ιδεαλίστρια φοιτήτρια, έχει γυρίσει σπίτι για τις διακοπές. Ο Τζον και η Σαβάνα προέρχονται από διαφορετικούς κόσμους, αλλά όταν συναντηθούν τυχαία στην παραλία, θα αισθανούν αμέσως την αμοιβαία έλξη. Η συνάντησή τους θα οδηγήσει σε δύο εβδομάδες θυελώδους έρωτα και τα αισθήματά τους γρήγορα θα βαθύνουν σε μια παθιασμένη, ολοκληρωτική σχέση. Ο καθένας θ' ανακαλύψει στον άλλον κάτι που ποτέ δε γνώριζε ότι του έλειπε. Οταν ο Τζον θ' αναγκαστεί να επιστρέψει στο μέτωπο και η Σαβάνα στο πανεπιστήμιο, υπόσχονται ότι θα γράφουν ο ένας στον άλλον. Μέσα από μια συνεχόμενη σειρά γραμμάτων, η αγάπη τους εξακολουθεί ν' ανθίζει, όσο ξεδιπλώνεται μια βαθιά ρομαντική ερωτική ιστορία, για τους πρώτους έρωτες και τις δεύτερες ευκαιρίες.

How To Train Your Dragon 2 Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Animation Sequel HD

It's been five years since Hiccup and Toothless successfully united dragons and vikings on the island of Berk. While Astrid, Snoutlout and the rest of the gang are challenging each other to dragon races (the island's new favorite contact sport), the now inseparable pair journey through the skies, charting unmapped territories and exploring new worlds. When one of their adventures leads to the discovery of a secret ice cave that is home to hundreds of new wild dragons and the mysterious Dragon Rider, the two friends find themselves at the center of a battle to protect the peace. Now, Hiccup and Toothless must unite to stand up for what they believe while recognizing that only together do they have the power to change the future of both men and dragons.

From DreamWorks Animation comes a surprising tale about growing up, finding the courage to face the unknown…and how nothing can ever train you to let go.  What began as an unlikely friendship between an adolescent Viking and a fearsome Night Fury dragon has become an epic adventure spanning their lives.  Welcome to the most astonishing chapter of one of the most beloved animated franchises in film history: How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.  

Now chief and ruler of Berk alongside Astrid, Hiccup has created a gloriously chaotic dragon utopia.  When the sudden appearance of female Light Fury coincides with the darkest threat their village has ever faced, Hiccup and Toothless must leave the only home they’ve known and journey to a hidden world thought only to exist in myth.  As their true destines are revealed, dragon and rider will fight together—to the very ends of the Earth—to protect everything they’ve grown to treasure.

For How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, series director Dean DeBlois returns alongside the all-star cast.  The film is produced by Brad Lewis (Ratatouille, ANTZ) and Bonnie Arnold (Toy Story, How to Train Your Dragon,How to Train Your Dragon 2).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
As Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) owns up to being Iron Man before the world press, Anton Vanko lies dying in Russia. Years ago, Anton worked with Tony's father to create a new source of energy. But greed got the best of Anton, and now as he slips away, his son, Ivan (Mickey Rourke), vows to make Tony pay for the sins of his father. Meanwhile, Tony fends off efforts from smarmy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) and military weapons expert Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) to get him to divulge the secrets of his powerful Iron Man suit. The powers that be are concerned that Tony's technology may fall into the wrong hands -- fears that are soon confirmed when the cocky billionaire entrepreneur is confronted in front of the entire world by Ivan, who has built his own weapon using stolen Stark blueprints. Later, as Lt. Rhodes (Don Cheadle) wrestles with the decision to personally deliver Tony's suit to the military, Ivan finds an unlikely ally in the quest to destroy Iron Man; Stark Industries legal consultant Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) reveals her connection to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson); and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) takes on some new responsibilities.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
As Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) owns up to being Iron Man before the world press, Anton Vanko lies dying in Russia. Years ago, Anton worked with Tony's father to create a new source of energy. But greed got the best of Anton, and now as he slips away, his son, Ivan (Mickey Rourke), vows to make Tony pay for the sins of his father. Meanwhile, Tony fends off efforts from smarmy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) and military weapons expert Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) to get him to divulge the secrets of his powerful Iron Man suit. The powers that be are concerned that Tony's technology may fall into the wrong hands -- fears that are soon confirmed when the cocky billionaire entrepreneur is confronted in front of the entire world by Ivan, who has built his own weapon using stolen Stark blueprints. Later, as Lt. Rhodes (Don Cheadle) wrestles with the decision to personally deliver Tony's suit to the military, Ivan finds an unlikely ally in the quest to destroy Iron Man; Stark Industries legal consultant Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) reveals her connection to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson); and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) takes on some new responsibilities.

Birth of a legend. Following King Richard's death in France, archer Robin Longstride, along with Will Scarlett, Alan-a-Dale and Little John, returns to England. They encounter the dying Robert of Locksley, whose party was ambushed by treacherous Godfrey, who hopes to facilitate a French invasion of England. Robin promises the dying knight he will return his sword to his father Walter in Nottingham. Here Walter encourages him to impersonate the dead man to prevent his land being confiscated by the crown, and he finds himself with Marian, a ready-made wife. Hoping to stir baronial opposition to weak King John and allow an easy French take-over, Godfrey worms his way into the king's service as Earl Marshal of England and brutally invades towns under the pretext of collecting Royal taxes. Can Robin navigate the politics of barons, royals, traitors, and the French?

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Trapped in a parachuting tank, the A-Team finds a unique way to save themselves.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Director Joe Carnahan resurrects the popular 1980s-era action series with this explosive reboot following the adventures of four Iraq War veterans who begin a second career as mercenaries for hire. Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith (Liam Neeson), Templeton ""Face"" Peck (Bradley Cooper), B.A. Baracus (Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson), and H.M. ""Howlin' Mad"" Murdock (Sharlto Copley) are a group of former Special Forces operatives who have been fighting the good fight for eight years when they're sentenced to military prison for a crime they didn't commit. Breaking out with relative ease, they embark on a treacherous quest to clear their names while being hunted across the globe by Charissa Sosa (Jessica Biel), a high-ranking military officer and one of Face's many former lovers. Meanwhile, mysterious CIA operative Lynch (Patrick Wilson) offers tips that help point the federal fugitives in the right direction, which seems to lead straight to former military contractor Pike (Brian Bloom), who may have been responsible for setting them up in the first place. Just when it seems that the A-Team has all the evidence needed to prove their innocence, however, they discover that their latest mission is just getting started.

This project has been an incredible undertaking, and we’ve made the decision to have this complete by 2019. At this time, I’m not quite sure what a release will look like, but I do know that this has to be done by next year. We’re both pursuing college and full-time careers right now, and it’s time to wrap this side-project up.

We do not own Toy Story 3. This is simply a project inspired by the incredible film and studio that is Disney-Pixar. 

Thank you for the support. Feel free to follow the project’s Facebook page:

Well, if you\u2019re Shrek, you suddenly wind up a domesticated family man. Instead of scaring villagers away like he used to, a reluctant Shrek now agrees to autograph pitch forks. What\u2019s happened to this ogre\u2019s roar? Longing for the days when he felt like a \u201creal ogre,\u201d Shrek is duped into signing a pact with the smooth\u2014talking dealmaker, Rumpelstiltskin. Shrek suddenly finds himself in a twisted, alternate version of Far Far Away, where ogres are hunted, Rumpelstiltskin is king and Shrek and Fiona have never met. Now, it\u2019s up to Shrek to undo all he\u2019s done in the hopes of saving his friends, restoring his world and reclaiming his one True Love. (Source)

The continuing adventures of the big, green ogre Shrek and his buddies, living in the land of Far, Far Away. (Source)

A domesticated Shrek hatches a plan to recapture his mojo and discovers what life in Far Far Away land would have been like had he never existed in this final chapter of the popular animated film series. There used to be a time when the villagers would run in terror at the mere mention of the name Shrek, but these days the big green ogre is married to Princess Fiona and raising triplets. Maintaining your fierce public persona is no simple task when you're juggling infants and changing diapers, so when Shrek realizes that nobody is afraid of him anymore he recruits mischief-maker Rumpelstiltskin to restore his once-mighty roar. Unfortunately for Shrek, that plan hits an unexpected hitch. As a result, the morose monster takes a trip into an alternate-universe Far Far Away land where there is no Shrek, and Rumpelstiltskin reigns. There, Donkey spends his days hauling carts, and a portly Puss in Boots prefers lounging to swashbuckling. Perhaps with a little extra effort, Shrek will be able to regain his status as top ogre in town and still have his happily ever after, too. - Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide (Source)",2010-03-21T23:59:14Z,"['Shrek', 'Forever', 'After', 'Official', 'Trailer', 'New']",53659,276,12,23,10192,0.46202090592334494

Film Description: A mysterious criminal mastermind has stolen one of the pyramids in Egypt, sparking a fit of jealous envy in evil genius Gru (Steve Carell), who hasn't managed to make headlines since he and his minions swiped the Times Square JumboTron years back. Ever since Gru was a little boy, he dreamed of going to the moon. Now, if Gru can just build a rocket and get his hands on a powerful shrink-ray, he can cement his reputation as the greatest thief who ever lived by stealing the Earth's satellite right out of the sky. But immediately after Gru heists the shrink-ray, the cunning super-nerd Vector (Jason Segel) swoops in and snatches it right out of his hands. Now, in order to claim the moon, Gru must first reacquire the weapon from Vector. Armed with the knowledge that his nemesis has a mean sweet tooth, Gru adopts cookie-selling orphans Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Agnes (Elsie Fisher), and Edith (Dana Gaier) and commissions a new line of cookie robots from the evil Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), his personal weapons specialist. But as Gru and his diminutive yellow minions prepare to carry out the biggest heist in history, something strange happens. Gru discovers that the three little girls who have come into his life are much more than simple pawns. They actually seem to care about Gru, and it turns out the scheming evildoer makes a pretty good father. When Gru realizes that his upcoming moon mission clashes with a ballet performance by the girls, he must decide what's more important -- being a present parent or cementing his nefarious reputation once and for all.",2011-06-16T13:01:49Z,"['despicable me', 'despicable me trailer', 'despicable me part 1', 'despicable me song', 'steve carell', 'jack mcbrayer', 'mindy kaling', 'davis desmond', 'chris renaud', 'pierre coffin', 'toy videos', 'children family', 'family animation', 'family comedies', 'christopher meledandri', 'janet healy', 'robert taylor', 'john cohen', 'nina rappaport', 'sergio pablos', 'discovery videos', 'humor videos', 'desert videos', 'egypt videos', 'justin', 'gru', 'movie clips', 'movieclipsdotcom', '#AMG:V+++475296', '/m/04t2l2', '/m/0h3mrc', '/m/0h27vc']",17816680,19397,5230,1,20352,0.3500821018062397

Until the day he encounters the immense will of three little orphaned girls who look at him and see something that no one else has ever seen: a potential Dad.

So it should come as no surprise that Gru has an entire army of not-so-bright Minions to help him carry out his diabolical plans....unless they get distracted by a Moo Cow toy! The Minions are creatures of unknown origin - small, yellow and seemingly indestructible.  Hardworking and devoted to their leader and his mad exploits, they are content to serve as Gru's crash test dummies along the way.

Entertainment,UCgKkNPU2Ib7_TcyAl8M2S-w,"Acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan directs an international cast in this sci-fi actioner that travels around the globe and into the world of dreams. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the best there is at extraction: stealing valuable secrets inside the subconscious during the mind's vulnerable dream state. His skill has made him a coveted player in industrial espionage but also has made him a fugitive and cost him dearly. Now he may get a second chance if he can do the impossible: inception, planting an idea rather than stealing one. If they succeed, Cobb and his team could pull off the perfect crime. But no planning or expertise can prepare them for a dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy only Cobb could have seen coming. Available on Blu-ray & DVD 12/7!

In Columbia Pictures' The Karate Kid, 12-year-old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) could've been the most popular kid in Detroit, but his mother's (Taraji P. Henson) latest career move has landed him in China. Dre immediately falls for his classmate Mei Ying - and the feeling is mutual - but cultural differences make such a friendship impossible. Even worse, Dre's feelings make an enemy of the class bully, Cheng. In the land of kung fu, Dre knows only a little karate, and Cheng puts ""the karate kid"" on the floor with ease. With no friends in a strange land, Dre has nowhere to turn but maintenance man Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), who is secretly a master of kung fu. As Han teaches Dre that kung fu is not about punches and parries, but maturity and calm, Dre realizes that facing down the bullies will be the fight of his life.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
When a young boy (Jaden Smith) struggles to adjust to his new life in China, a kindly instructor (Jackie Chan) takes him under his wing to teach him self-defense.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
When a 12-year-old from Detroit moves to China with his mother and incurs the wrath of the class bully at his new school, he makes an unlikely ally in the form of his aging maintenance man, a kung fu master who teaches him the secrets to self-defense. Upon arriving at his new school, Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) develops a powerful crush on pretty classmate Mei Ying. The feeling is mutual, although the cultural divide between Dre and Mei Ying makes a friendship unlikely, and romance impossible. When cruel classmate and kung fu prodigy Cheng learns of Dre's feelings for Mei Ying, he harasses and humiliates the young outsider in front of the entire school. With no one to turn to for help, Dre confides his fears in kindly maintenance man Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), a kung fu master who knows that serenity and maturity -- not punches and power -- are the true keys to mastering the martial arts. As Dre prepares to face down his intimidating tormentor, he begins to realize that the real fight is just beginning.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
When Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) suggests they play ""good cop, bad cop"", Gamble (Will Ferrell) misreads the situation and goes bananas on Ershon (Steve Coogan).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
A desk-jockey detective and his tough-talking partner get their moment to shine in this buddy police comedy starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, and directed by Adam McKay (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby). New York City detective Allen Gamble (Ferrell) is more comfortable pushing pencils than busting bad guys. A meticulous forensic accountant, his numbers are never off. Detective Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg) is Gamble's reluctant partner. Try as Detective Hoitz might to get back on the streets, an embarrassing encounter with Derek Jeter has left a sizable black mark on his permanent record. Detectives Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) are the complete opposites of Gamble and Hoitz: unwaveringly confident, they always get their man, and they do it with style to spare. When the time comes for Gamble and Hoitz to prove their mettle and save the day, their incompetence becomes the stuff of legend.

ip_CYHdyUBs,The Expendables 2 (2012) - Official Trailer #1,Lionsgate Movies,UCJ6nMHaJPZvsJ-HmUmj1SeA,"THE EXPENDABLES are back and this time it's personal...

Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren),Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) -- with newest members Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) and Maggie (Yu Nan) aboard -- are reunited when Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) enlists the Expendables to take on a seemingly simple job. The task looks like an easy paycheck for Barney and his band of old-school mercenaries. But when things go wrong and one of their own is viciously killed, the Expendables are compelled to seek revenge in hostile territory where the odds are stacked against them. Hell-bent on payback, the crew cuts a swath of destruction through opposing forces, wreaking havoc and shutting down an unexpected threat in the nick of time — six tons of weapons-grade plutonium; enough to change the balance of power in the world. But that's nothing compared to the justice they serve against the villainous adversary who savagely murdered their brother. 

That is done the Expendables way....

In THE EXPENDABLES 3, Barney (Stallone), Christmas (Statham) and the rest of the team comes face-to-face with Conrad Stonebanks (Gibson), who years ago co-founded The Expendables with Barney. Stonebanks subsequently became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to kill... or so he thought. In order to defeat Stonebanks, Barney decides that he has to fight old blood with new blood, and brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy. The latest mission becomes a clash of classic old-school style versus high-tech expertise in the Expendables' most personal battle yet.

A bass guitarist for garage band Sex Bob-omb, the 22-year-old has just met the girl of his dreams...literally.  The only catch to winning Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead)?  Her seven evil exes are coming to kill him.  Genre-smashing filmmaker Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) tells the amazing story of one romantic slacker's quest to power up with love in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

Scott Pilgrim has never had a problem getting a girlfriend.  It's getting rid of them that proves difficult.  From the girl who kicked his heart's ass—and now is back in town—to the teenage distraction he's trying to shake when Ramona rollerblades into his world, love hasn't been easy.  He soon discovers, however, his new crush has the most unusual baggage of all: a nefarious league of exes controls her love life and will do whatever it takes to eliminate him as a suitor.  

As Scott gets closer to Ramona, he must face an increasingly vicious rogues' gallery from her past—from infamous skateboarders to vegan rock stars and fearsome identical twins.  And if he hopes to win his true love, he must vanquish them all before it really is game over.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
From visionary director David Fincher (Fight Club, Seven) comes the story of the founding of massive social website, Facebook. Adapted from Ben Mezrich's 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires, the film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Director David Fincher (Fight Club, Seven) teams with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing) to explore the meaning of success in the early 21st century from the perspectives of the technological innovators who revolutionized the way we all communicate. The year was 2003. As prohibitively expensive technology became affordable to the masses and the Internet made it easy to stay in touch with people who were halfway across the world, Harvard undergrad and computer programming wizard Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) launched a website with the potential to alter the very fabric of our society. At the time, Zuckerberg was just six years away from making his first million. But his hearty payday would come at a high price, because despite all of Zuckerberg's wealth and success, his personal life began to suffer as he became mired in legal disputes, and discovered that many of the 500 million people he had friended during his rise to the top were eager to see him fall. Chief among that growing list of detractors was Zuckerberg's former college friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), whose generous financial contributions to Facebook served as the seed that helped the company to sprout. And some might argue that Zuckerberg's bold venture wouldn't have evolved into the cultural juggernaut that it ultimately became had Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) not spread the word about Facebook to the venture capitalists from Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) engage Zuckerberg in a fierce courtroom battle for ownership of Facebook that left many suspecting the young entrepreneur might have let his greed eclipse his better judgment. The Social Network was based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich.

uaaC57tcci0,The Social Dilemma | Official Trailer | Netflix,Netflix,UCWOA1ZGywLbqmigxE4Qlvuw,"We tweet, we like, and we share— but what are the consequences of our growing dependence on social media? As digital platforms increasingly become a lifeline to stay connected, Silicon Valley insiders reveal how social media is reprogramming civilization by exposing what’s hiding on the other side of your screen.

https://Netflix.com/thesocialdilemma

ABOUT THE SOCIAL DILEMMA

The world has long recognized the positive applications of social media, from its role in empowering protesters to speak out against oppression during the Arab Spring uprisings almost a decade ago, to serving an instrumental role in fighting for equity and justice today. And in 2020, during an astonishing global pandemic, social media has become our lifeline to stay in touch with loved ones, as well as proving to be an asset for mobilizing civil rights protests. However, the system that connects us also invisibly controls us. The collective lack of understanding about how these platforms actually operate has led to hidden and often harmful consequences to society—consequences that are becoming more and more evident over time, and consequences that, the subjects in The Social Dilemma suggest, are an existential threat to humanity.

The Social Dilemma is a powerful exploration of the disproportionate impact that a relatively small number of engineers in Silicon Valley have over the way we think, act, and live our lives. The film deftly tackles an underlying cause of our viral conspiracy theories, teenage mental health issues, rampant misinformation and political polarization, and makes these issues visceral, understandable, and urgent. Through a unique combination of documentary investigation and entertaining narrative drama, award-winning filmmakers Jeff Orlowski (Chasing Ice, Chasing Coral) and Larissa Rhodes (Chasing Coral) have once again exposed the invisible in a manner that is both enlightening and harrowing as they disrupt the disrupters by unveiling the hidden machinations behind everyone’s favorite social media and search platforms. 

The film features compelling interviews with high-profile tech whistleblowers and innovation leaders including Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology; the co-inventor of the Facebook “Like” button, Justin Rosenstein; Tim Kendall, former President of Pinterest and former Director of Monetization at Facebook; Cathy O’Neil, author of Weapons of Math Destruction; Rashida Richardson, Director of Policy at the AI Now Institute, and many others. Demonstrating how social media affects consumers on a personal level, these fascinating insider insights are seamlessly woven into a captivating narrative, including Vincent Kartheiser (Mad Men), that illuminates the very real consequences these seemingly innocent technologies can have on our everyday lives.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
From the director of Gone Baby Gone, comes a crime film set in the streets of Boston, where four bank robbers including Doug (Ben Affleck) and James (Jeremy Renner) are chased by an FBI agent (Jon Hamm). To complicate matters, Doug falls in love with the woman (Rebecca Hall) he took as a hostage.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Boston bank robber Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) falls for a woman his gang had previously taken hostage after feigning a chance meeting with her to ensure that she can't identify them in Affleck's adaptation of author Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves. The son of a tough Charlestown, MA thief, Doug passed on his chance to walk the straight and narrow in favor of becoming a career bank robber. Not only is Doug's crew one of the most ruthless in Boston, but they're also one of the best; they never leave a trace of evidence, and always make a clean break. Over the years, Doug's fearless partners in crime have become something of a surrogate family to him; Jem (Jeremy Renner), the most dangerous of the bunch, is the closest thing Doug has ever had to a brother. But a divide begins to open between the two career criminals when Jem takes bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage during a particularly tense heist, and the group subsequently discovers that she hails from their own tight-knit suburb. When Jem proposes that the gang make an effort to find out just how much Claire recalls about the crime, Doug fears that his volatile partner may do more harm than good and volunteers himself for the job. Later, Doug turns on the charm while pretending to bump into Claire by chance, and becomes convinced that she doesn't suspect him of being the same man who just robbed her bank. As the feds turn up the heat on the gang, Doug finds himself falling for Claire, and searching desperately for a means of cutting his ties to his criminal past. But with each passing day, Jem grows increasingly suspicious of Doug's true motivations. Now caught between two worlds with no chance of turning back, Doug realizes that his only hope for finding a happy future is to betray the only family he's ever known.

In this charming, critically acclaimed tale of rumors and reputation, Olive (Emma Stone), an average high school student, sees her below-the-radar existence turn around overnight once she decides to use the school's gossip grapevine to advance her social standing. Now her classmates (Amanda Bynes, Aly Michalka) are turning against her and the school board is becoming concerned, including her favorite teacher (Thomas Haden Church) and the distracted guidance counselor (Lisa Kudrow). With the support of her hilariously idiosyncratic parents (Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson) and a little help from a long-time crush (Penn Badgley), Olive attempts to take on her notorious new identity and crush the rumor mill once and for all.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Emma Stone stars as Olive, a clean-cut high school virgin, whose life begins to parallel Hester Prynne's in ""The Scarlett Letter,"" After a little white lie about losing her virginity gets out, Olive finds herself the victim of the rumor mill, which she twists around for her own social advancement.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter is re-imagined as a contemporary high school comedy in this tale of a scheming student who plots to give her popularity a boost by painting herself the easiest lay in school. Like most high school kids, Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) just wants to be popular. So much so than when her best friend, Rhiannon (Aly Michalka), asks Olive how her weekend went, the bored teen decides to whip up a spicy white lie just to make things interesting. But that minor exaggeration begins to take on a life of its own when it reaches the ears of motor-mouth gossip Jesus freak Marianne (Amanda Bynes), and in no time the entire student body is abuzz over unassuming Olive's unrepentant weekend of debauchery. Of course not a word of it is true, but that doesn't stop everyone in school from talking, and an amused Olive from deciding to go with the flow. Playing the role of the hussy to the hilt, the girl who used to be invisible begins dressing provocatively and turning heads in the hallways. The students aren't the only ones taking notice, either; Olive's English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church), is concerned that the kind of attention she's receiving isn't healthy for a developing girl, and his wife (Lisa Kudrow), the school guidance counselor, is in full agreement. The only people who seem remotely interested in the truth are Olive's trusting and open-minded parents (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson). As Olive takes note of the parallels between her own situation and the plight of the Scarlet Letter heroine Hester Prynne, she realizes that she may be able to manipulate her newfound notoriety to give fellow classmate Brandon's (Dan Byrd) popularity a much-needed shot in the arm. Olive never thought her little game could possibly have any negative effect on anyone but herself, but when loose lips start sinking ships all around her, she realizes that it's high time for the truth to come out.

White is cold and always yearning burdened by a royal test
Black the beast descends from shadows
Yellow beauty burns gold

In Theaters August
https://www.goodboysmovie.com/

Just how bad can one day get? The creative minds behind Superbad, Pineapple Express and Sausage Party take on sixth grade hard in the outrageous comedy, Good Boys. 

After being invited to his first kissing party, 12-year-old Max (Room’s Jacob Tremblay) is panicking because he doesn’t know how to kiss. Eager for some pointers, Max and his best friends Thor (Brady Noon, HBO’s Boardwalk Empire) and Lucas (Keith L. Williams, Fox’s The Last Man On Earth) decide to use Max’s dad’s drone – which Max is forbidden to touch – to spy (they think) on a teenage couple making out next door. 

But when things go ridiculously wrong, the drone is destroyed. Desperate to replace it before Max’s dad (Will Forte, The Last Man on Earth) gets home, the boys skip school and set off on an odyssey of epically bad decisions involving some accidentally stolen drugs, frat-house paintball, and running from both the cops and terrifying teenage girls (Life of the Party’s Molly Gordon and Ocean’s Eight’s Midori Francis). 

From Point Grey producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the writers of Superbad, Pineapple Express and Sausage Party, and James Weaver (Neighbors), Good Boys, from Universal Pictures and Good Universe, is written by the team of Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky (NBC’s The Office, Bad Teacher). Eisenberg also produces and Stupnitsky directs.",2019-03-11T13:17:23Z,"['Good boys', 'good boys red band trailer', 'good boys trailer', 'red band trailer', 'good boys red band', 'red band', 'good boys movie', 'seth rogen', 'seth rogen trailer', 'seth rogen movie', 'jacob tremblay', 'keith Williams', 'brady noon', 'good boys restricted trailer', 'restricted trailer', 'nsfw trailer', 'nsfw']",3084393,29922,2048,2473,39514,0.29615384615384616

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Aron (James Franco) falls, discovering to his horror that he is stuck.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
James Franco stars in director Danny Boyle's inspiring survival drama based on the incredible true story of Aron Ralston, who became trapped alone in a Utah canyon for days after slipping on a loose rock, and resorted to extraordinary measures in order to make it out of his dire predicament alive. An experienced hiker and climber, Ralston (Franco) is very much in his element when he parks his truck by a mountain near Moab, UT, hops on his bike, and peddles to the middle of nowhere. Later, when Ralston encounters a pair of young female hikers who have gotten lost while searching for a local landmark, he jovially shows them a sight that most casual hikers miss before bidding them farewell and continuing on his way. Drifting through the canyons alone, deep in thought, however, the explorer who presumed he was ready for anything quickly discovers just how fast things can spin out of control when a rock gives way as he shimmies down a crevice, and pins his hand to the unforgiving wall of stone. Over the course of the next 127 hours, Ralston tries everything he can think of to free himself, flashing back to small but memorable events in his life -- as well as forward to the future that he might enjoy should he manage to wiggle free -- as his body begins the slow process of shutting down. Eventually realizing that the only way out is to leave part of himself behind, the exhausted, delirious adventurer draws his cheap made-in-China multi-tool, and does what it takes to survive.

Gennem hans rejse genkalder han minder med venner, familie, elskere og to hikere, han mødte inden ulykken. Over fem dage gransker Ralston sit liv og overlever elementerne, før han finder modet og midlerne til at befri sig selv fra den ekstreme situation. 127 HOURS er en gribende fortælling, der fortæller, hvor lang man kan nå, når man vælger at leve livet. .

Megamind es el supervillano más brillante que el mundo haya conocido y el que menos éxito tiene. Durante años, ha estado intentando conquistar Metro City de cualquier manera que se pueda imaginar. Cada intento, un fracaso, por culpa del superhéroe con capa llamado ""Metro Man"", un héroe invencible hasta el día en que Megamind le mata de verdad en el curso de uno de sus malvados y enrevesados planes. De repente, Megamind se queda sin objetivos. Es un supervillano sin un superhéroe. Se da cuenta de que haber cumplido el sueño de su vida es lo peor que le ha podido pasar. Megamind decide que la única forma de salir de su estancamiento es crear un nuevo héroe contrincante llamado ""Titán"", que promete ser más grande, mejor y más fuerte de lo que Metro Man fue nunca. Rápidamente, Titán empieza a pensar que es mucho más divertido ser uno de los malos que uno de los buenos. Sólo que Titán no quiere conquistar el mundo, quiere destruirlo. Entonces, Megamind tiene que decidirse: ¿podrá derrotar a su diabólica creación? ¿Podrá el hombre más inteligente del mundo tomar una decisión inteligente de una vez por todas? ¿Podrá el malvado genio convertirse en el insólito héroe de su propia historia?

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final adventure in the Harry Potter film series, is a much-anticipated motion picture event to be told in two full-length parts. Part 1 begins as Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort's immortality and destruction--the Horcruxes. On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart. Meanwhile, the wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort...alive. Harry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale--the legend of the Deathly Hallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks. Little does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became ""the Boy Who Lived.""

The new trailer for Disney's upcoming feature animation comedy Tangled. Starring the voices of Mandy Moore as Rapunzel, Zachary Levi as Flynn Rider, Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel, Ron Perlman, Jeffrey Tambor and Brad Garrett. Disney's Tangled is a classic story with a twist, and lots of hair.


Tangled' was released in UK Cinemas in 2011. Walt Disney Pictures presents Tangled, one of the most hilarious, hair-raising tales ever told. When the kingdom's most wanted -- and most charming -- bandit, Flynn Rider (voice of Zachary Levi), hides out in a mysterious tower, he's taken hostage by Rapunzel (voice of Mandy Moore), a beautiful and feisty tower-bound teen with 70 feet of magical, golden hair. Flynn's curious captor, who's looking for her ticket out of the tower where she's been locked away for years, strikes a deal with the handsome thief and the unlikely duo set off on an action-packed escapade, complete with a super-cop horse, an over-protective chameleon and a gruff gang of pub thugs.

Walt Disney Pictures presents Tangled, one of the most hilarious, hair-raising tales ever told. When the kingdom's most wanted -- and most charming -- bandit, Flynn Rider (voice of Zachary Levi), hides out in a mysterious tower, he's taken hostage by Rapunzel (voice of Mandy Moore), a beautiful and feisty tower-bound teen with 70 feet of magical, golden hair. Flynn's curious captor, who's looking for her ticket out of the tower where she's been locked away for years, strikes a deal with the handsome thief and the unlikely duo set off on an action-packed escapade, complete with a super-cop horse, an over-protective chameleon and a gruff gang of pub thugs. Disney's Tangled is a story of adventure, heart, humour and hair -- lots of hair.

Starring the voices of Mandy Moore as Rapunzel, Zachary Levi as Flynn Rider, Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel, Ron Perlman, Jeffrey Tambor and Brad Garrett.

NOW PLAYING EVERYWHERE

Dicky Ecklund (CHRISTIAN BALE) is a former boxing legend that squandered his talents and threw away his shot at greatness.

Micky Ward (MARK WAHLBERG), his half brother, is the struggling journeyman boxer
who spent his life living in his big brother's shadow.   

The Fighter is the inspirational, true story of these two brothers who, against all the odds,
come together to train for a historic title bout that will unite their fractured family, redeem
their pasts and, at last, give their hard-luck town what it's been waiting for: pride.  The story
unfolds on the gritty, blue-collar streets of Lowell, Mass, where Dicky was once known as
""The Pride of Lowell"" having gone the distance with the world champion Sugar Ray Leonard.
However, after losing that fight, like the town of Lowell, Dicky's fallen on hard times.  His
boxing days are behind him and his life has become shattered by drug abuse.   

Younger brother Micky, meanwhile, has become the family's fighter and fading hope for a
champion.  But despite all of his work, Micky's career is failing and he loses fight after
punishing fight.  Dicky and Micky's tougher-than-nails mother, Alice (MELISSA LEO),
manages his career and Dicky serves as his highly unreliable trainer.  When Micky's latest
fight nearly kills him, it looks like it could all be over -- until his iron-willed new girlfriend,
Charlene (AMY ADAMS), convinces him to do the unthinkable:  split with his family, pursue
his own interests and train without his increasingly volatile and criminal brother.  

Now Micky has the chance of a lifetime as he earns a shot at the World Championship.
But when his brother and dysfunctional family reenter his life, they must all reconcile their
pasts and become more than just a family in name.  With Micky and Dicky reunited, this
becomes more than just a fight -- it's an all-out comeback for these brothers, their family, and
their city.  When it's over, Micky will have become a World Champion, a Hall of Fame
legend, and the new ""Pride of Lowell"". 

The Fighter is a moving and often humorous drama about fighting for the people you love.",2013-06-05T17:25:26Z,"['trailer', 'film', 'alliance', 'drama', 'movie', 'mark', 'whalberg']",885486,2963,88,150,45317,0.3031400966183575

Micky Ward und Dicky Eklund. Zwei Brüder. Zwei Boxer. Dicky, der ältere der beiden, hat seine besten Zeiten längst hinter sich. Inzwischen ist er nur noch ein abgehalfterter Crack-Junkie. Auch Micky ist der große Durchbruch als Boxer bislang verwehrt geblieben. Sein Bruder wird als Trainer auf Grund der Drogensucht immer unzuverlässiger, und seine Mutter Alice macht ihren Job als Managerin mehr schlecht als recht. Micky muss als Aufbaugegner für schwerere Gegner herhalten und verliert Kampf auf Kampf. Als nach einer weiteren Niederlage sein Bruder auch noch im Gefängnis landet, beschließt Micky, die Boxhandschuhe an den Nagel zu hängen. Doch seine Freundin Charlene überzeugt ihn davon, dass er ohne die zweifelhafte Unterstützung seiner Familie bessere Chancen als Profiboxer hätte. Mit neuem Trainer und neuem Management macht Micky sich an die Vorbereitung auf einen weiteren Kampf – und gewinnt.

Inspirada en una increíble historia real, nos llega la áspera pero cariñosamente humorística historia del regreso de un héroe del boxeo poco común: Micky Ward ""El Irlandés"" (MARK WAHLBERG) y de su hermanastro, Dicky Eklund (CHRISTIAN BALE), quienes tuvieron que enfrentarse como contrincantes antes de unirse como hermanos en una dura pelea para ganar un importante campeonato y fortalecer sus lazos familiares. 
Con años de preparación, The Fighter fue filmada en tan sólo 33 días en las calles de los barrios obreros de Lowell, Massachusetts.  Al comienzo, los productores David Hoberman y Todd Lieberman se enamoraron de la historia de Micky y Dicky y vieron que se trataba de mucho más que de una victoria deportiva.  La estrella y productor Mark Wahlberg, el director David O. Russell, un reparto y un equipo muy unido, se juntaron para hacer que la familia de Micky y de Dicky profundamente humana cobre vida a través de una serie de momentos alternativamente cómicos, tiernos, dolorosos y triunfantes que se desarrollan tanto en la sala de estar como en el ring de boxeo.
La historia comienza cuando Dicky, orgullo de la ciudad que una vez peleó ferozmente contra Sugar Ray Leonard, se enfrenta a tiempos difíciles.  Mientras tanto, Micky se ha convertido en el luchador de la familia, con su incipiente carrera en manos de su madre Alice (MELISSA LEO).  Sin embargo, a pesar de su gran gancho izquierdo, siempre lo castigan en el ring. Cuando la más reciente lucha de Micky casi lo mata, es persuadido por la voluntad de hierro de su nueva novia, Charlene (AMY ADAMS), de hacer lo impensable: separarse de su familia, perseguir sus propios intereses y entrenar lejos de su problemático hermano.  
  Entonces, se le presenta a Micky la oportunidad de su vida en una pelea por el título, pero pronto queda claro que hará falta la fortaleza de su hermano y de toda la familia para que llegue allí. Desafiando a los detractores, apuesta por una decisión que traerá nuevamente a Dicky, Charlene, Alice y toda la familia Ward/ Eklund a su esquina del ring y dará como resultado una de la cadenas de victorias más sorprendentes de este deporte.  De la nada, Micky se convertirá en un campeón, conocido como un luchador resistente y leal que peleó la batalla más difícil de todos, por su familia.",2011-01-28T13:00:04Z,"['THE FIGTHER', 'Tripictures', 'MARK WAHLBERG', 'CHRISTIAN BALE', 'MELISSA LEO', 'AMY ADAMS', 'David O.

But things are not as they seem and the disgraced Kendra, a witch masquerading as a high school student, enacts the perfect revenge.  She transforms Kyle into someone as unattractive on the outside as he is on the inside.  Now he has one year to find someone to love him, or he will remain ""Beastly"" forever.

Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway previously left jaws dropped with approving disbelief in the adult movie ""Brokeback Mountain."" Years later, after both leaped from one box-office hit to another, Gyllenhaal and Hathaway reunite in the upcoming romantic comedy ""Love And Other Drugs"" for a slap of the awe-stunning realities in adult relationships.
Directed by Edward Zwick and based on Jamie Reidy's humorous memoir ""Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman,"" the movie tells the story of Reidy's stint as Pfizer salesman in the 1990s. As a salesman for Pfizer and considered to be the Jerry Maguire of the prescriptive drug world, Reidy (played by Gyllenhaal) gets involved with Maggie (Hathaway) who won't let anything or anyone tie her down.

Lucy and Edmond are spending a dreary holiday with their cousin Eustace Clarence Scrub, who is a rather dour and mean spirited little boy. They are unexpectedly drawn into Narnia when a painting of a ship on the wall of Lucy's room comes to life, and the three children fall into the ocean to be rescued be the Dawn Treader.

Once safely on board, Lucy and Edmond are greeted by their friend Caspian (now King Caspian) who has undertaken a quest to find the seven lost Lords of Narnia, as he had previously promised to Aslan. Lucy and Edmond are delighted to be back in Narnia, but Eustace is less than enthusiastic. Reepicheep is also on board, as he has vowed to find the seas of the 'utter east'.

Joining forces once again with their royal friend Prince Caspian and the warrior mouse Reepicheep, they are whisked away on a mysterious mission to the Lone Islands, and beyond. On this bewitching voyage that will test their hearts and spirits, the trio will face magical Dufflepuds, sinister slave traders, roaring dragons and enchanted merfolk. Only an entirely uncharted journey to Aslan's Country - a voyage of destiny and transformation for each of those aboard the Dawn Treader - can save Narnia, and all the astonishing creatures in it, from an unfathomable fate.

Oggi, a distanza di quasi sei anni, molte cose sono cambiate: Salle ha lasciato il posto al tedesco Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck e si è proposto come sceneggiatore. Il ruolo dell'agente è stato invece assegnato ad Angelina Jolie, dopo che per mesi era stata data per certa la presenza di Charlize Theron. Simile trafila ha riguardato anche la scelta dell'interprete maschile: Tom Cruise, inizialmente individuato come protagonista, è stato prima sostituito con Sam Avatar Worthington e poi - per ragioni artistiche, come si legge su ogni comunicato - da Johnny Depp.",2010-09-30T09:21:31Z,"['the', 'tourist', 'official', 'trailer', 'film', 'movie', 'preview', 'footage', 'florian', 'henckel', 'von', 'donnersmarck', 'johnny', 'depp', 'angelina', 'jolie', 'paul', 'bettany', 'thriller', 'drama']",71515,11,0,4,37710,0.41691616766467066

Frank ist The Tourist, ein Amerikaner auf dem Weg nach Italien, um sich nach einer schmerzhaften Trennung ein wenig abzulenken. Die Ablenkung folgt auf den Fuß, als er im Zug nach Venedig der atemberaubenden Elise begegnet. Es dauert nicht lange und er ist Hals über Kopf in die schöne Unbekannte verliebt. Was Frank jedoch nicht weiß: Das Ganze war keine zufällige Begegnung, sondern Elise hat sich Frank ganz bewusst ausgesucht, um die Verfolger ihres Ex-Freundes Alexander Pearce in die Irre zu führen. Dieser ist nämlich nicht nur ein Gangster, der in vierzehn Staaten gesucht wird, sondern Alexander ist auch noch im Besitz von gestohlenem Geld, das jemand wieder haben möchte. Von einem Moment auf den anderen findet sich Frank in The Tourist deshalb in der Situation, nicht nur von einem Agenten gejagt zu werden, sondern auch noch zum Ziel eines Gangsters geworden zu sein.

TRON: LEGACY is a 3D high-tech adventure set in a digital world that's unlike anything ever captured on the big screen. Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), a rebellious 27-year-old, is haunted by the mysterious disappearance of his father Kevin Flynn (Oscar®- and Golden Globe®-winner Jeff Bridges), a man once known as the world's leading video-game developer.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
The Fockers (Ben Stiller, Teri Polo) are back, this time for Christmas with their kids and the in-laws (Robert De Niro, Blythe Danner).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
A birthday party for the twins gives Greg an opportunity to redeem himself after he takes a job that raises the suspicions of his overbearing father-in-law, Jack (Robert De Niro), in this installment of the hit comedy series. Greg (Ben Stiller) and Pam (Teri Polo) have been together for ten years, and now they're the proud parents of two adorable twins. But money is tight, and in order to keep his family afloat, devoted nurse Greg takes a second job working for a drug company. But that development doesn't sit well with Jack, whose previous suspicions regarding his hapless son-in-law soon come back in full force after learning of this development. With the twins' birthday fast approaching, the proud parents invite the entire clan over to celebrate in style, including Kevin (Owen Wilson), who still carries a torch for his pretty ex Pam. As the festivities get under way, Greg takes every opportunity available to prove to Jack that he's fully capable of providing for his family. Now Greg has one last chance to prove that he's trustworthy. Should he fail, the circle of trust will be broken for good. Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Laura Dern, and Jessica Alba co-star.

Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) is a slacker by day, party animal by night... until he finds a serious career that's seriously cool: crime-fighting action hero. As the Green Hornet, he teams up with gadget wiz and martial arts master Kato (Jay Chou) to take down LA's underworld. Even Britt's assistant Lenore (Cameron Diaz) doesn't suspect this mismatched pair is the masked duo busting the city's toughest thugs led by Chudnofsky (Academy Award® winner Christoph Waltz, 2010, Supporting Actor, Inglourious Basterds). With style, swagger and an arsenal of awesome gear, the Green Hornet and Kato are doing justice their way, making every mission a mix of over-the-top action and outrageous comedy.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Billionaire bad boy Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) decides to become a superhero known to villians as The Green Hornet. Based on the comic book.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In the 3D action-comedy The Green Hornet, Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) is the son of LA's most prominent and respected media magnate and perfectly happy to maintain a directionless existence on the party scene - until his father (Tom Wilkinson) mysteriously dies, leaving Britt his vast media empire. Striking an unlikely friendship with one of his father's more industrious and inventive employees, Kato (Jay Chou), they see their chance to do something meaningful for the first time in their lives: fight crime. To get close to the criminals, they come up with the perfect cover: they'll pose as criminals themselves. Protecting the law by breaking it, Britt becomes the vigilante The Green Hornet as he and Kato hit the streets. Using all his ingenuity and skill, Kato builds the ultimate in advanced retro weaponry, Black Beauty, an indestructible car equal parts firepower and horsepower. Rolling in a mobile fortress on wheels and striking the bad guys with Kato's clever gadgets, The Green Hornet and Kato quickly start making a name for themselves, and with the help of Britt's new secretary, Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz), they begin hunting down the man who controls LA's gritty underworld: Benjamin Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz). But Chudnofsky has plans of his own: to swat down The Green Hornet once and for all. -

A mysterious stranger (Daniel Craig) and a hard-boiled Colonel (Harrison Ford) become reluctant allies when aliens invade the Old West.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
1875. New Mexico Territory. A stranger (Craig) with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford). It's a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been, he realizes he holds a secret that could give the town a fighting chance against the alien force. -

Blockbuster filmmaker Jon Favreau directs Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford in an event film for summer 2011 that crosses the classic Western with the alien-invasion movie in a blazingly original way: Cowboys & Aliens.  Joined by an arsenal of top moviemakers—Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci—he brings an all-new action thriller that will take audiences into the Old West, where a lone cowboy leads an uprising against a terror from beyond our world.

1875.  New Mexico Territory.  A stranger (Craig) with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution.  The only hint to his history is a mysterious shackle that encircles one wrist.  What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford).  It's a town that lives in fear.

But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky.  Screaming down with breathtaking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the helpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever known.

Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation.  As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been, he realizes he holds a secret that could give the town a fighting chance against the alien force.  With the help of the elusive traveler Ella (Olivia Wilde), he pulls together a posse comprised of former opponents—townsfolk, Dolarhyde and his boys, outlaws and Apache warriors—all in danger of annihilation.  United against a common enemy, they will prepare for an epic showdown for survival.  

The screenplay for Cowboys & Aliens is by Roberto Orci & Alex Kurtzman & Damon Lindelof and Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby, from a screen story by Fergus & Ostby and Steve Oedekerk.

Jon Favreau, regista blockbuster, dirige Daniel Craig e Harrison Ford, nel film/evento dell'estate 2011, dove il western classico si incrocia un un'invasione di alieni in una combinazione esplosiva ed originale: Cowboys & Aliens. Ispirandosi a registi eccezionali - Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, Alex Kurtzman e Roberto Orci -- Favreau ci regala un nuovo thriller pieno di azione che trasporterà il pubblico in un Far West dove un cowboy solitario guiderà una rivolta contro una paura dell'altro mondo.

1873. Arizona. Uno straniero (Craig) senza passato si imbatte nella remota città di Absolution, nel bel mezzo del deserto. Unico accenno alla sua storia è una misteriosa sorta di manetta intorno a un polso. L'uomo scopre in fretta che la gente di Absolution non è propensa a dare il benvenuto agli stranieri; e che nessuno fa una mossa per le strade della città, a meno che l'ordine non arrivi da parte del colonnello Dolarhyde (Ford). La città che vive sotto il suo pugno di ferro, nella paura.
Ma Absolution sta per sperimentare un terrore ben peggiore quando la desolata città viene attaccata dai predoni dal cielo. Con velocità mozzafiato e luci accecanti, rapiscono uno ad uno gli umani impotenti, sfidando i cittadini in ogni modo possibile.
Ora, lo straniero che hanno respinto diventa la loro unica speranza di salvezza. Man mano che il pistolero comincia lentamente a ricordare chi è, e da dove viene, si rende conto di nascondere un segreto che potrebbe dare alla città la possibilità di contrastare la forza aliena. Con l'aiuto della viaggiatrice solitaria Ella (Olivia Wilde), mette insieme una squadra composta da ex-nemici - gente del luogo, Dolarhyde e i suoi ragazzi, fuorilegge e guerrieri Apache - tutti accomunati dall'essere ugualmente in pericolo. Uniti contro un nemico comune, dovranno prepararsi per una prova di forza epica per la sopravvivenza.
La sceneggiatura di Cowboys & Aliens e di Alex Kurtzman e Roberto Orci (Star Trek) e Damon Lindelof (della serie televisiva Lost), basato sulla graphic novel di Platinum Studios creato da Scott Mitchell Rosenberg.

Offizieller deutscher Kino-Trailer zu dem Film ""Unknown User"".

Originaltitel: Cybernatural
Horrorthriller, US 2015
Filmverleih: Universal Pictures
Kinostart (DE): 16.07.2015

Schauspieler/Darsteller: Shelley Hennig, Renee Olstead, Will Peltz, Jacob Wysocki, Heather Sossaman, Matthew Bohrer u.a.

Regisseur: Levan Gabriadze

---

Ein Jahr ist es her, seit sich High-School-Schönheit Laura (Heather Sossaman) auf der Party eines Mitschülers bis auf die Knochen blamierte. Ein Jahr, seit das Video ihres peinlichen Fehltrittes ins Internet gestellt wurde und Lauras Ruf auf einen Schlag ruinierte. Ein Jahr, seit sich Laura auf tragische Weise das Leben genommen hat. Heute Nacht versammeln sich sechs ihrer Mitschüler auf Skype, um über Lauras Tod zu reden. Bis sich eine unbekannte siebte Person mit Lauras Konto einloggt und alle Anwesenden warnt: Wer versucht, den Chat zu verlassen - stirbt. Wer sich weigert, zu reden - stirbt. Wer die Wahrheit über die Ereignisse im vergangenen Jahr verschweigt - stirbt. Ist Lauras Geist zurückkehrt, um Rache zu nehmen? Oder spielt jemand den sechs Freunden einen grausamen Streich? 

Genrefilmexperte Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Wächter der Nacht, Abraham Lincoln - Vampirjäger) als Produzent und die innovativen visuellen Ideen von Regietalent Levan Gabriadze (Lucky Trouble) lassen Unknown User zum packenden und unvorhersehbaren Horrorthriller mit hochaktuellem Bezug werden: Zwischen Cyber-Bullying, Social-Media-Wahn, FOMO und Always-On-Mentalität trifft Unknown User perfekt den Zeitgeist und wird so zum furchteinflößenden Blair Witch Project für die Generation Web.

Two British comic-book geeks (Simon Pegg & Nick Frost) traveling across the U.S. encounter an alien outside Area 51 who needs their help.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) reunite for the comedy adventure Paul as two sci-fi geeks whose pilgrimage takes them to America's UFO heartland. While there, they accidentally meet an alien who brings them on an insane road trip that alters their universe forever. For the past 60 years, an alien named Paul (Seth Rogen) has been hanging out at a top-secret military base. For reasons unknown, the space-traveling smart ass decides to escape the compound and hop on the first vehicle out of town -- a rented RV containing Earthlings Graeme Willy (Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Frost). Chased by federal agents and the fanatical father of a young woman that they accidentally kidnap, Graeme and Clive hatch a fumbling escape plan to return Paul to his mother ship. And as two nerds struggle to help, one little green man might just take his fellow outcasts from misfits to intergalactic heroes. Paul is directed by Superbad's Greg Mottola, from a story by Pegg & Frost. Joining the comedy's cast are Jason Bateman, Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Blythe Danner, Joe Lo Truglio, John Carroll Lynch, David Koechner and Sigourney Weaver. -

Paul hadn’t planned to release an album in 2020, but in the isolation of “Rockdown,” he soon found himself fleshing out some existing musical sketches and creating even more new ones.

Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) reunite for the comedy adventure Paul as two sci-fi geeks whose pilgrimage takes them to America's UFO heartland.  While there, they accidentally meet an alien who brings them on an insane road trip that alters their universe forever.

For the past 60 years, an alien named Paul (Seth Rogen) has been hanging out at a top-secret military base.  For reasons unknown, the space-traveling smart ass decides to escape the compound and hop on the first vehicle out of town—a rented RV containing Earthlings Graeme Willy (Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Frost).  

Chased by federal agents and the fanatical father of a young woman that they accidentally kidnap, Graeme and Clive hatch a fumbling escape plan to return Paul to his mother ship.  And as two nerds struggle to help, one little green man might just take his fellow outcasts from misfits to intergalactic heroes.

Paul is directed by Superbad's Greg Mottola, from a story by Pegg & Frost.  Joining the comedy's cast are Jason Bateman, Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Blythe Danner, Joe Lo Truglio, John Carroll Lynch, David Koechner and Sigourney Weaver.",2011-02-25T01:03:08Z,"['Paul', 'Paul the movie', 'What Is Paul', 'Simon Pegg', 'Nick Frost', 'Kristen Wiig', 'Jason Bateman', 'Bill Hader', 'Joe Lo Truglio', 'Blythe Danner', 'Sigourney Weaver', 'David Koechner', 'Jesse Plemons', 'Jeffrey Tambor', 'Jane Lynch', 'Greg Mottola', 'Edgar Wright', 'Superbad', 'Hot Fuzz', 'Shaun of the Dead', 'alien', 'aliens', 'alien movie', 'area 51', 'road trip', 'Seth Rogen', 'official trailer', 'trailer']",139581,382,21,69,39513,0.3977272727272727

Paul, Apostle of Christ is the story of two men. Luke, as a friend and physician, risks his life every time he ventures into the city of Rome to visit Paul, who is held captive in Nero’s darkest, bleakest prison cell. Before Paul’s death sentence can be enacted, Luke resolves to write another book, one that details the beginnings of “The Way” and the birth of what will come to be known as the church. But Nero is determined to rid Rome of Christians, and does not flinch from executing them in the grisliest ways possible. 
Bound in chains, Paul’s struggle is internal. He has survived so much—floggings, shipwreck, starvation, stoning, hunger and thirst, cold and exposure—yet as he waits for his appointment with death, he is haunted by the shadows of his past misdeeds. Alone in the dark, he wonders if he has been forgotten . . . and if he has the strength to finish well.
Two men struggle against a determined emperor and the frailties of the human spirit in order to bequeath the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the world.",2018-01-30T20:41:00Z,"['paul', 'apostle of christ', 'luke', 'rome', 'jim caviezel', 'olivier martinez', 'james faulkner', 'trailer', 'affirm films', 'sony', 'official trailer', 'faith', 'films', 'march 23']",3723115,35510,879,3176,39513,0.29295454545454547

Johnny Depp trabajará nuevamente con Gore Verbinski, el exitoso director de la saga de Piratas del Caribe. Se trata de una película animada de la productora Paramount: Rango.Johnny le dará la voz al personaje principal, que será nada menos que una mascota hogareña que tiene problemas de identidad, ya que quiere conocer su verdadero yo, y para ello parte en un viaje de auto descubrimiento.
El guión ya ha sido escrito por John Logan, que escribió grandes películas como El Aviador (2004), Sweeney Todd (2007), The Last Samurai (2003), Gladiator (2000) y otras tantas conocidas. Ya había escrito para una animación con Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (2003).
La idea general de la palícula, igualmente, fue del director Gore Verbinski, quien obviamente será quien dirija la obra. También la producirá con su productora Blind Wink junto con otras productoras.
Según dijeron se utilizarán técnicas de animación por ordenador de última generación nunca vistas.
En enero del año próximo comenzará la producción, y la Paramount planea estrenar la película en marzo de 2011.
SINOPSIS: RANGO es la historia de un solitario camaleón en un día de soledad en la inmensidad del desierto Mojave. Rango quiere ser un representante de la ley en un sediento pueblo llamado Dirt. Este lagarto actor siempre ha querido interpretar el papel de héroe y por fin encuentra un público que necesita uno. Rango enseguida se da cuenta de que hay gran diferencia entre actuar y la vida real y se ve forzado a enfrentarse a algunos aspectos de su identidad y a aprender el significado de la amistad.

Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a 'mechanic' - an elite assassin with a strict code and unique talent for cleanly eliminating targets.  It's a job that requires professional perfection and total detachment, and Bishop is the best in the business.  But when his mentor and close friend Harry (Donald Sutherland) is murdered, Bishop is anything but detached.  His next assignment is self-imposed - he wants those responsible dead.  His mission grows complicated when Harry's son Steve (Ben Foster) approaches him with the same vengeful goal and a determination to learn Bishop's trade.  Bishop has always acted alone but he can't turn his back on Harry's son.  A methodical hit man takes an impulsive student deep into his world and a deadly partnership is born.  But while in pursuit of their ultimate mark, deceptions threaten to surface and those hired to fix problems become problems themselves.",2010-11-24T16:34:23Z,"['trailer', 'film', 'action', 'jason', 'stratham', 'alliance', 'british', 'movie']",60674,86,6,19,27582,0.5074257425742574

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A horror/romance reimagining of the classic story. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke and starring Amanda Seyfried

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) is a beautiful young woman torn between two men. She is in love with a brooding outsider Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), but her parents have arranged for her to marry the wealthy Henry (Max Irons). Unwilling to lose each other, Valerie and Peter are planning to run away together when they learn that Valerie's older sister has been killed by the werewolf that prowls the dark forest surrounding their village. For years, the people have maintained an uneasy truce with the beast, offering the creature a monthly animal sacrifice. But under a blood red moon, the wolf has upped the stakes by taking a human life. Hungry for revenge, the people call on famed werewolf hunter, Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), to help them kill the wolf. But Solomon's arrival brings unintended consequences as he warns that the wolf, who takes human form by day, could be any one of them. As the death toll rises with each moon, Valerie begins to suspect that the werewolf could be someone she loves. Panic grips the town as Valerie discovers that she has a unique connection to the beast-one that inexorably draws them together, making her both suspect...and bait.-

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Raised by her father, an ex-CIA agent, in the wilds of Finland, Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) lives a life unlike any other teenager. Her upbringing and training have been geared to making her the perfect assassin.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) is 16 years old. She is bright, inquisitive, and a devoted daughter. Uniquely, she has the strength, the stamina, and the smarts of a soldier; these come from being raised by her widowed father Erik (Eric Bana), an ex-CIA man, in the wilds of North Finland. Erik has taught Hanna to hunt, put her through extreme self-defense workouts, and home-schooled her with only an encyclopedia and a book of fairy tales. Hanna has been living a life unlike any other teenager; her upbringing and training have been one and the same, all geared to making her the perfect assassin. But out in the world there is unfinished business for Hanna's family, and it is with a combination of pride and apprehension that Erik realizes his daughter can no longer be held back. -

#LoveAndThunder is a sequel to Thor: Ragnarok, and Avengers: Endgame. The film will adapt a Lady Thor story arc from the recent Marvel Comics series The Mighty Thor. It is the twenty-ninth film in the MCU and sixth and final film of Phase Four.

──────────────────

Following the smash-hit success of his movie Thor: Ragnarok, Taika Waititi is returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe once again to write and direct the fourth installment in the Thor series, Thor: Love and Thunder.

The film will see Natalie Portman’s Jane Foster take on the role of Lady Thor. It’s fair to say that this particular Marvel sequel won’t be one to miss.

Marvel boss Kevin Feige announced at Comic-Con that Natalie Portman will return to the MCU as Jane Foster. But this time around, she will reportedly become a female God of Thunder herself, when Thor is unable to lift his hammer due to apparent unworthiness (a theme previously explored in Avengers: Endgame and in a popular comic-book run that the film is directly inspired by).

On top of this, it’s been confirmed that Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson will return as Thor and Valkyrie.

It’s possible that Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk could appear in the film following his starring role in Thor: Ragnarok (Ruffalo supposedly still has one film left on his Marvel contract), or some team members from the Guardians of the Galaxy, last seen giving Thor a ride into space.

Other upcoming Marvel Studios projects include Black Widow on May 1, 2020, The Falcon and The Winter Soldier in Fall 2020, The Eternals on November 6, 2020, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings on February 12, 2021, WandaVision in Spring 2021, Loki in Spring 2021, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness on May 7, 2021, Spider-Man 3 on July 16, 2021, What If…? in Summer 2021, Hawkeye in Fall 2021, and Black Panther 2 on May 6, 2022. Marvel Studios Disney+ series without release dates include Ms. Marvel, Moon Knight, and She-Hulk.

#Thor4 is due out November 5, 2021.

Vin Diesel and Paul Walker lead a reunion of returning all-stars from every chapter of the explosive franchise built on speed in Fast Five.  In this installment, former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) partners with ex-con Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) on the opposite side of the law.  Dwayne Johnson joins returning favorites Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar for this ultimate high-stakes race. 

Since Brian and Mia Toretto (Brewster) broke Dom out of custody, they've blown across many borders to elude authorities.  Now backed into a corner in Rio de Janeiro, they must pull one last job in order to gain their freedom.  As they assemble their elite team of top racers, the unlikely allies know their only shot of getting out for good means confronting the corrupt businessman who wants them dead.  But he's not the only one on their tail.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Two women battle to plan their friend's wedding party.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Director Paul Feig and producer Judd Apatow team up again for this comedy that stars Kristen Wiig as Annie, a romantically unattached failed bakery owner who fears she's losing her BFF, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), the best thing in her life, when Lillian announces she's gotten engaged. Annie's anxieties deepen as Lillian grows close to Helen (Rose Byrne), a wealthy and beautiful new friend who quickly assumes control of planning all the pre-wedding festivities. On top of the main storyline of a female friendship being torn apart, the movie adds a romantic storyline for Annie, who starts the film answering a booty call from the casually cruel yet undeniably handsome Ted (Jon Hamm), but develops a lovely flirtation with an Irish cop named Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) after he pulls Annie over one night thinking she's driving drunk. As the low-self-esteem Annie sabotages this new possibility for love, she also feels the most important friendship in her life slipping away.

When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the formidable pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know who to fear more: Blackbeard or the woman from his past.",2011-03-17T22:49:41Z,"['Walt', 'Disney', 'motion', 'pictures', 'films', 'film', 'picture', 'studio', 'pirate', 'pirates', 'of', 'the', 'caribbean', 'on', 'stranger', 'tides', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Penelope', 'Penélope', 'Cruz', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Kevin', 'McNally', 'Astrid', 'Berges', 'Frisbey', 'sam', 'Claflin', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'black', 'beard', 'adventure', 'jack', 'sparrow', 'pearl', 'captain', 'fun', 'humor', 'action', 'fountain', 'youth', 'mysterious', 'ocean', 'boat', 'sea', 'mermaid', 'mermaids', 'sword', 'swords', 'fights', 'fighting', 'zombies', 'legendary', 'summer', 'movie', 'imax', '3d', 'trailer', 'first', 'look', 'official', 'exclusive', 'hd', 'newest']",1157739,3030,76,572,1865,0.6781818181818182

LITERAL Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides Trailer

LYRICS:

Pan cross ocean.
Zoom into a mountain.
Someone's not good a lighting torches.
Rocky beaches.
Corona commercial set.
Close-up mini-waterfall.
Ready the tattered holy sail...
Nevermind let's go look for a trail.
Hot hot hot hot hot hot NOT.
Dramatic main character reveal.
Slow fade-in, Jack negotiating.
Fireworks then Disney castle.
Jerry Bruckheimer, there's an archway.
Rapid pan-down, Jack's in trouble.
Mutton chops stand up cut.
Jack's been drinkiing,
now he's wading,
now he's walking to a meeting.
He just looked at the camera!
Did you see that?
Two shot.
More shot.
Still drunk.
From Disney and Jerry.
Pirate peg-leg look at a boat.
Make an agreement,
cheer, mermaids, hothothothothothothot.
Rotating zombie-boat's captain is too hot.
Jack Sparrow informs her he's taking the boat.
She expresses distaste in this idea by stabbing the door.
Don't slam the door on your hot pirate captain.
And director Rob Marshall,
careful, grab a rock.
Jack warns his crew not to make out with hot water ladies.
Unless you look like them, then take what you can get.
Raise your sword overboard.
Point your sword forward.
Fail to drown, looking down.
Stab the table by a candle.
Man, girl look up look left.
The mermaid is less hot nowww...
Jack is still terrified of the last mermaid shot.
When he calms down Johnny Depp leans
through some leaves, then he looks right.
Jack jumps up, lean.
Penelope then jumps into the fight.
Ian McShane shoots some fireballs at a guy sitting on a boat.
Geoffrey Rush needs some lotion... or maybe some aloe?
Swinging a sword at a hot pirate's basically first base.
Bouncing up, make a gesture.
This summer, get ready to DANCE!  (Then fall in a lake.)
Explosive boat, hold a rope, don't tailgate him.
Girls in water boxes, dodge a barrel like Donkey Kong.
Look down don't waterfall, swing, zoom, kiss, boat, spin, dark.
Falling and falling and falling and falling and LAND IN A LAKE.
SKULL ZOOM! 
In comes the title, and it slowly zooms back out.
Show the release date, then show lots of names.

매일 밤 12시, 시간을 넘나드는 로맨스가 시작된다!

약혼자 '이네즈'(레이첼 맥아담스)를 두고 
홀로 파리의 밤거리를 배회하던 '길'(오웬 윌슨)은 
종소리와 함께 꿈처럼 시간 여행을 하게 된다.

 그곳에서 1920년대를 대표하는 예술가들과 조우하는 길. 
  
 그 날 이후 매일 밤 1920년대로 떠난 '길'은 
 평소에 동경하던 예술가들과 친구가 되어 꿈 같은 시간을 보내게 되고 
 헤밍웨이와 피카소의 연인이자 뮤즈인 ‘아드리아나’(마리옹 꼬띠아르)를 
 만나게 된다. 시간이 지날수록 ‘길’은 예술과 낭만을 사랑하는 
 매혹적인 그녀에게 빠져들게 되는데…

TERRENCE MALICK has always created thought-provoking, intensely visual and viscerally emotional films of our times, each one a distinct experience rife with mystery and depth.   His new film, THE TREE OF LIFE, may be simultaneously his most intimate and epic work yet. A hymn to life, it excavates answers to the most haunting and personal human questions through a kaleidoscope of the intimate and the cosmic, from the raw emotions of a family in a small Texas town to the wildest, infinite edges of space and time, from a boy's loss of innocence to a man's transforming encounters with awe, wonder and transcendence.
