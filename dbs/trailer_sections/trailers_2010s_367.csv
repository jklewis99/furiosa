49XERl-IrI0,Thor: Ragnarok - Trailer Music [HQ Trailer Edit | Magic Sword; Hi-Finesse - Omega],ThatDudeRightThere,UC2AcWSxkfAqIVYJroIxK-HA,"So yeah... Comic-Con happened and brought us some fantastic new trailers! This is the music featured in the new SDCC trailer for Marvel's ""Thor: Ragnarok"", as usual with some of the original sound effects and taken directly from the trailer with lots of small adjustments for volume consistency and elimination of the more distracting sounds and noises. I've also shortened the part in the end without music (Thor's and Hulk's chatter) a bit.

This trailer's music consists of ""In the Face of Evil"" by Magic Sword and (from 0:53 until the end) ""Omega"" by Hi-Finesse, composed by Joseph Bauer. While the former is available for purchase in its entirety, Hi-Finesse has announced that they are not able to release ""Omega"" to the public as it is a custom piece for this trailer. I encourage you to buy their released music in stores though, in order to support the artists:

In doing so, she hopes to land her crush Toby (Nick Eversman), and find the confidence to overthrow the school’s ruthless label maker Madison (Bella Thorne) by reminding everyone that no matter what people look or act like, we are all someone’s DUFF…and that’s totally fine.

Pictures Brasil,UCEOVI4AmQE01FDKNFunkV2w,"Assista o desenrolar dessa trama e intriga no trailer de BROOKLYN - SEM PAI NEM MÃE com o Escritor/Diretor Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, com Alec Baldwin e Willem Dafoe. 5 de Dezembro nos Cinemas. 

Edward Norton dirigiu, escreveu, produziu e estrela Brooklyn – Sem Pai Nem Mãe. A jornada do filme às telas teve início em 1999, quando Norton viu o potencial cinematográfico do livro de Jonathan Lethem Motherless Brooklyn e seu protagonista inesquecível. Porém, desde o começo, Norton quis transportar os personagens contemporâneos criados por Lethem a uma época e trama diferentes, ambientando o drama nos anos 1950 – uma época de mudanças profundas em Nova York.
Brooklyn – Sem Pai Nem Mãe acompanha Lionel Essrog (Norton), um detetive particular solitário que convive com a síndrome de Tourette, conforme tenta solucionar o assassinato de seu mentor e único amigo, Frank Minna (Bruce Willis). Munido somente de algumas pistas e a força de sua mente obsessiva, Lionel desvenda segredos guardados a sete chaves que colocam o destino da cidade inteira em cheque. Em um mistério que o leva desde clubes de jazz no Harlem até os cortiços sombrios do Brooklyn e às suntuosas propriedades dos figurões mais influentes de Nova York, Lionel tem que lidar com capangas, corrupção e o homem mais perigoso da cidade para honrar seu amigo e salvar a mulher que pode ser sua própria salvação.
O elenco inclui Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Bobby Cannavale, Cherry Jones, Michael Kenneth Williams, Leslie Mann, Ethan Suplee, Dallas Roberts, Josh Pais, Robert Ray Wisdom e Fisher Stevens, com Alec Baldwin e Willem Dafoe.
Norton também produziu o filme com seu sócio na Class 5 Films Bill Migliore; Gigi Pritzker e Rachel Shane da MWM Studios; e Michael Bederman. Os produtores executivos foram Adrian Alperovich, Sue Kroll, Daniel Nadler, Robert F. Smith e Brian Niranjan Sheth.
Nos bastidores, Norton colaborou com o diretor de fotografia duas vezes indicado ao Oscar Dick Pope (“Mr. Turner”, “O Ilusionista”), a desenhista de produção Beth Mickle (“Drive”, “Beleza Oculta”), o editor indicado ao Oscar Joe Klotz (“Preciosa - Uma História de Esperança”, “O Mordomo da Casa Branca”) e a figurinista Amy Roth (da série de TV “The Looming Tower”, “Indignação”).  
A música tem um papel importante para estabelecer a época em que Brooklyn – Sem Pai Nem Mãe se passa e sua ambientação. A trilha foi composta por Daniel Pemberton (“Venom”, “A Grande Jogada”) e tem como destaque Wynton Marsalis tocando trompete. O filme também traz uma canção original escrita e interpretada por Thom Yorke.
A Warner Bros. Pictures apresenta Brooklyn – Sem Pai Nem Mãe, uma produção da Class 5 Films / MWM Studios. O filme será distribuído mundialmente pela Warner Bros. Pictures e tem previsão de lançamento no Brasil em 5 de dezembro de 2019.",2019-08-22T16:00:04Z,"['Motherless Brooklyn', 'Lionel Essrog', 'Frank Minna', 'Julia Minna', 'Uma Forma de Asssassinato', 'Gone Baby Gone', 'Primal Fear', 'A Walk Among the Tombstones', 'Leave of Grass', 'Força Policial', 'O Infiltrado', 'Warner Brothers', 'WB', 'Warner Bros', 'Warner Media', 'Warner', 'Film Warner', 'Trailer', 'Official Trailer', 'Crime', 'Drama', 'Edward Norton', 'Bruce Willis', 'Leslie Mann', 'Alec Baldwin', 'William Dafoe', 'Gugu Mbatha-Raw', 'Bobby Cannavale', 'Michael Kenneth Williams', 'and Cherry Jones', 'Johnathan Lethem']",654032,1633,31,86,167073,0.1271186440677966

Why It's FilmBuff: From looking back to Greenwich Village in the 60's to Chicago in the 20's, we're excited to see what influences our tastes.  Through Brooklyn Boheme, Nelson George examines the artists who created the movement that began in Fort Green, Brooklyn.   Before the hipsters and gentrification of Brooklyn, artists like Spike Lee used Brooklyn to communicate their point of view and inspire a generation.  Brooklyn Boheme shows us the significance of Fort Green and what a neighborhood can mean in cultivating cultural influence worldwide.

The Hateful Eight opens in theaters on December 25th, 2015.

In THE HATEFUL EIGHT, set six or eight or twelve years after the Civil War, a stagecoach hurtles through the wintry Wyoming landscape. The passengers, bounty hunter John Ruth (Russell) and his fugitive Daisy Domergue (Leigh), race towards the town of Red Rock where Ruth, known in these parts as “The Hangman,” will bring Domergue to justice. Along the road, they encounter two strangers: Major Marquis Warren (Jackson), a black former union soldier turned infamous bounty hunter, and Chris Mannix (Goggins), a southern renegade who claims to be the town’s new Sheriff. Losing their lead on the blizzard, Ruth, Domergue, Warren and Mannix seek refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stagecoach stopover on a mountain pass. When they arrive at Minnie’s, they are greeted not by the proprietor but by four unfamiliar faces. Bob (Bichir), who’s taking care of Minnie’s while she’s visiting her mother, is holed up with Oswaldo Mobray (Roth), the hangman of Red Rock, cow-puncher Joe Gage (Madsen), and Confederate General Sanford Smithers (Dern). As the storm overtakes the mountainside stopover, our eight travelers come to learn they may not make it to Red Rock after all…

En su último año de instituto, Quentin no ha aprobado ni en popularidad ni en asuntos del corazón... Pero todo cambia cuando su vecina, la legendaria, inalcanzable y enigmática Margo Roth Spiegelman, se presenta en mitad de la noche para proponerle que le acompañe en un plan de venganza inaudito. Después de una intensa noche que reaviva el vínculo de una infancia compartida y parece sellar un nuevo destino para ambos, Margo desaparece dejando tras de sí un extraño cerco de pistas. Con un estilo único que combina humor y sensibilidad, John Green, el autor de Bajo la misma estrella, teje una emotiva historia a la que da vida un inolvidable elenco de personajes.

上映日期: 8月13日

「二十世紀福斯影片」榮譽呈獻，今年暑假最注目愛情鉅獻──《紙上城市》(PAPER TOWNS)，是美國爆紅作家John Green繼《生命中的美好缺憾》後，第二部把其暢銷小說搬上大銀幕的力作。

昆汀（拿特洛夫）從小開始，已經單戀著任性勇敢的漂亮鄰居瑪歌（卡拉迪樂芬妮），唯二人多年來生活天差地遠，一直沒機會好好交流。直到一個特別的深夜，瑪歌突然潛入昆汀大宅，並站在他面前，要求他協助一連串對偷食男友的報復行動；昆汀被殺個措手不及，只好乖乖答應女神一切。通宵冒險結束後，瑪歌被發現離奇失蹤，她的家人和警察都咬定是個小玩笑，只有昆汀察覺出箇中異樣。昆汀找來摯友們，根據她反常舉動及刻意留下的蛛絲馬跡，開始搜尋旅程；零碎線索環環相扣，昆汀發現越接近目的地，越對自己從小認識的女神感到陌生。「你將前往紙上城市，永遠不會回來。」就是瑪歌留下的一些文字，引領著昆汀逐步走進這座現實與虛構交纏的城市。

A new Frozen short, Frozen Fever, featuring all of your favorite characters and a brand new song, will play in theatres with Cinderella beginning March 13!

The story of ""Cinderella"" follows the fortunes of young Ella (Lily James) whose merchant father remarries following the death of her mother. Eager to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and her daughters Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) and Drisella (Sophie McShera) into the family home. But, when Ella's father unexpectedly passes away, she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefully renamed Cinderella, Ella could easily begin to lose hope. Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her mother's dying words and to ""have courage and be kind."" She will not give in to despair nor despise those who mistreat her. And then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he is really a prince, not merely an apprentice at the Palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul. It appears her fortunes may be about to change when the Palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball, raising Ella's hopes of once again encountering the charming Kit (Richard Madden). Alas, her stepmother forbids her to attend and callously rips apart her dress. But, as in all good fairy tales, help is at hand, and a kindly beggar woman (Helena Bonham-Carter) steps forward and -- armed with a pumpkin and a few mice -- changes Cinderella's life forever.

The story of ""Cinderella"" follows the fortunes of young Ella (Lily James) whose merchant father remarries following the death of her mother. Eager to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and her daughters Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) and Drisella (Sophie McShera) into the family home. But, when Ella's father unexpectedly passes away, she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefully renamed Cinderella, Ella could easily begin to lose hope. Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her mother's dying words and to ""have courage and be kind."" She will not give in to despair nor despise those who mistreat her. And then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he is really a prince, not merely an apprentice at the Palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul. It appears her fortunes may be about to change when the Palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball, raising Ella's hopes of once again encountering the charming Kit (Richard Madden). Alas, her stepmother forbids her to attend and callously rips apart her dress. But, as in all good fairy tales, help is at hand, and a kindly beggar woman (Helena Bonham-Carter) steps forward and -- armed with a pumpkin and a few mice -- changes Cinderella's life forever.

Der Film Pan erzählt die Geschichte des ikonischen Charakters: Der kleine Peter Pan (Levi Miller) lebt in einem Londoner Waisenhaus. Seine verzweifelte Mutter hatte ihn dort im Jahr 1926 zurückgelassen. Peter stößt auf einen Brief, in dem sie ihm verspricht, dass sie sich eines Tages wiedersehen werden – in dieser Welt oder aber in einer anderen. Eines Nachts wird Peter Pan aus dem Waisenhaus von Piraten entführt und in die bunte und magische Welt von Nimmerland gebracht, in der nicht nur Schiffe fliegen können. Dort erkennt Peter Pan sein wahres Schicksal: Der mutige Junge will gemeinsam mit Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara) und James Hook (Garrett Hedlund) und vielen weiteren Unterstützern die Bewohner der Insel vor Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) und der Piratenbande retten.

Del director Joe Wright (“Expiación, más allá de la pasión”, “Orgullo y prejuicio”), “PAN Viaje a Nunca Jamás”, un largometraje de acción en vivo, presenta una aventura completamente original sobre los comienzos de  los  entrañables personajes creados por J.M. Barrie.
Peter (Levi Miller) es un pícaro muchacho de 12 años con una irreprimible vena rebelde; lo que ocurre es que, en el sombrío orfanato de Londres en el que ha vivido toda su vida, esas cualidades no son precisamente muy deseables. Entonces, en el curso de una noche increíble, Peter se ve transportado desde el orfanato y aparece en un mundo fantástico de piratas, guerreros y hadas llamado Nunca Jamás. Allí, se enfrenta a sorprendentes aventuras  y combates a vida o muerte mientras intenta descubrir el secreto de su madre, que le dejó en el orfanato hace mucho tiempo, y el lugar que le corresponde en esa tierra mágica. En compañía de la guerrera  Tigrilla (Rooney Mara) y de un nuevo amigo llamado Capitán Garfio (Garrett Hedlund), Peter debe derrotar al implacable pirata Barbanegra (Hugh Jackman) para salvar el país de Nunca Jamás y descubrir su auténtico destino: convertirse en el héroe que será conocido para siempre con el nombre de PAN Viaje a Nunca Jamás.
 Wright dirige “PAN Viaje a Nunca Jamás” a partir de un guión escrito por Jason Fuchs. Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter y el nominado al Oscar® Paul Webster (“Expiación, más allá de la pasión”) son los productores, junto con Tim Lewis como productor ejecutivo.
 La película está protagonizada por el nominado al Oscar®  Hugh Jackman (“Los Miserables”) como Barbanegra; Garrett Hedlund (“A propósito de Llewyn Davis”) como Capitán Garfio; la nominada al Oscar®  Rooney Mara (“Millennium: Los hombres que no amaban a las mujeres”) como Tigrilla; el recién llegado Levi Miller como Peter; y Amanda Seyfried (“Los Miserables”) como Mary.
Completando el reparto, están Adeel Akhtar (“El dictador) como Smee; Taejoo Na (“The Kick”) como Kwahu; Nonso Anozie (“Son of God”, “Expiación, más allá de la pasión”) como Bishop; Kathy Burke (“El topo”) como Madre Barnabas; Kurt Egyiawan (“Skyfall”) como Murray; Lewis MacDougall (la serie británica de televisión “In the Name of the Children”) como Nibs; y Jack Charles (“Mystery Road”) como El Jefe.
 El equipo creativo de Wright detrás de las cámaras está formado por los directores de fotografía nominados al Oscar® Seamus McGarvey (“Anna Karenina”, “Expiación, más allá de la pasión”) y John Mathieson (“El fantasma de la ópera”, “Gladiator”); la diseñadora de producción nominada al Oscar® Aline Bonetto (“Largo domingo de noviazgo”, “Amelie”); los encargados de montaje Paul Tothill (“Expiación, más allá de la pasión”, “Orgullo y prejuicio”), y William Hoy (“El amanecer del planeta de los simios”) la diseñadora de vestuario Jacqueline Durran (“Anna Karenina”); y la maquilladora y diseñadora de peluquería Ivana Primorac  (“The Imitation Game (Descifrando Enigma)”, “El señor de los anillos: El retorno del rey”). La música es del compositor nomiando a un Oscar®  John Powell (“Como entrenar a tu dragón”).
Warner Bros. Pictures presenta en asociación con Rat-Pac Dune Entertainment una producción de Berlanti, una película de Joe Wright, “PAN Viaje a Nunca Jamás”.  Filmada en los  estudios Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden, “PAN Viaje a Nunca Jamás” se estrenará en  3D y en 2D  a partir del 9 de octubre de 2015.

Ushering in a new era of horror, Universal Pictures’ Unfriended unfolds over a teenager’s computer screen as she and her friends are stalked by an unseen figure who seeks vengeance for a shaming video that led a vicious bully to kill herself a year earlier.

Directed by Levan Gabriadze, Unfriended is written by Levan Gabriadze and produced by Bekmambetov and Greaves, as well as Jason Blum for Blumhouse Productions (Ouija and Paranormal Activity, The Purge and Insidious series).

Hitman: Agent 47 Official Trailer #1 (2015) - Rupert Friend, Zachary Quinto Movie HD


HITMAN: AGENT 47 centers on an elite assassin who was genetically engineered from conception to be the perfect killing machine, and is known only by the last two digits on the barcode tattooed on the back of his neck. He is the culmination of decades of research—and forty-six earlier Agent clones—endowing him with unprecedented strength, speed, stamina and intelligence. His latest target is a mega-corporation that plans to unlock the secret of Agent 47’s past to create an army of killers whose powers surpass even his own.

Therese (Rooney Mara) träumt von einem Job als Setdesignerin beim Theater, doch stattdessen ist sie mit Richard (Jake Lacy) zusammen, den sie eigentlich gar nicht liebt. So schlägt sie sich durchs New York der 50er-Jahre und versucht, sich mit einem Job in einem Kaufhaus über Wasser zu halten. Eines Tages trifft sie Carol (Cate Blanchett), die Therese sogleich ihre Adresse gibt, damit ihre Einkäufe dorthin geliefert werden können. Aus einem Impuls heraus schickt Therese Carol eine Karte zu Weihnachten, auf die sie wider Erwarten eine Antwort erhält. Verbunden durch das Gefühl der Einsamkeit, beginnen die beiden Frauen, Zeit miteinander zu verbringen. Dabei entwickelt Theres starke Gefühle für Carol – sehr zum Missfallen von Carols Mann Harge (Kyle Chandler). Dieser droht, ihr die gemeinsame Tochter zu entziehen und für das alleinige Sorgerecht zu kämpfen. Alles, was er dazu braucht, sind handfeste Beweise für die geheime Liebschaft der Frauen. Harge zieht alle Register und engagiert einen Privatdetektiv, den er auf Therese und Carol ansetzt.

Die NASA treibt mit der „Ares 3“-Mission die Erforschung des Mars voran. Die Astronauten Mark Watney (Matt Damon), Commander Lewis (Jessica Chastain), Rick Martinez (Michael Peña), Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie) und Beth Johanssen (Katie Mara) sind auf dem roten Planeten gelandet, inklusive eines Fahrzeugs und eines Habitats, in dem die Forscher leben und Nahrung herstellen können. Doch ein Sandsturm droht die mitgebrachte Technik samt ihrer Einwohner hinwegzufegen, so dass Commander Lewis den Befehl zum sofortigen Aufbruch gibt. Weil ihn seine Crew für tot hält, bleibt der Botaniker Mark Watney auf dem unwirtlichen fremden Planeten zurück. Vorerst ohne Möglichkeit zur Kommunikation und mit beschädigter Ausrüstung versucht er, die wenigen ihm zur Verfügung stehenden Mittel so einfallsreich wie möglich zu nutzen. Und tatsächlich gelingt es Watney, der Erde zu signalisieren, dass er noch lebt. Die NASA unter Direktor Sanders (Jeff Daniels) beginnt, die Rettung des „Marsianers“ zu planen. Parallel dazu startet Watneys Crew eine eigene, riskante Mission, ihn heimzuholen…

Durante una missione su Marte, l’astronauta Mark Watney (Matt Damon) viene considerato morto dopo una forte tempesta e per questo abbandonato dal suo equipaggio. Ma Watney è sopravvissuto e ora si ritrova solo sul pianeta ostile. Con scarse provviste, Watney deve attingere al suo ingegno, alla sua arguzia e al suo spirito di sopravvivenza per trovare un modo per segnalare alla Terra che è vivo. 
A milioni di chilometri di distanza, la NASA e un team di scienziati internazionali lavorano instancabilmente per cercare di portare “il marziano"" a casa, mentre i suoi compagni cercano di tracciare un’audace, se non impossibile, missione di salvataggio. 

Basato sul romanzo best-seller “The Martian” di Andy Weir il film è diretto dal regista maestro Ridley Scott.
Cast: Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover .

In Disney•Pixar’s original movie “ Inside Out,” he will take us to the most extraordinary location of all—inside the mind. 

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco.

Il Centro di controllo della mente di Riley, una ragazzina di 11 anni, è localizzato nel Quartier Generale, dove cinque Emozioni sono al lavoro, guidate dalla simpatica e ottimista Gioia, la cui missione è di garantire la felicità di Riley. Le altre Emozioni comprendono Paura che garantisce alla ragazza la sicurezza necessaria, Rabbia che assicura il senso di equità e giustizia e Disgusto che impedisce a Riley di avvelenarsi sia fisicamente che socialmente. Tristezza non sa bene quale sia il suo ruolo come del resto non è chiaro neanche agli altri.  

Quando Riley si trasferisce con la sua famiglia in una nuova metropoli, le Emozioni dentro di lei si mettono subito al lavoro, desiderose di guidarla attraverso la difficile transizione. Tuttavia, Gioia e Tristezza vengono relegate in un angolo remoto della sua mente, lasciando spazio a Paura, Rabbia e Disgusto. Gioia e Tristezza si avventurano in luoghi sconosciuti fra cui la Memoria a Lungo Termine, Immagilandia, il Pensiero Astratto e la Cineproduzione, nel disperato tentativo di tornare al Quartier Generale e da Riley.

Diretto dal regista premio Oscar® Pete Docter (Monsters & Co., Up), prodotto da Jonas Rivera, p.g.a (Up), co-diretto da Ronnie Del Carmen (Up), il film Disney•Pixar Inside Out presenta la colonna sonora originale di Michael Giacchino (Gli Incredibili, Ratatouille, Up) e uscirà al cinema il 16 settembre 2015.

Il Web Talent Show #‎EMOZIONIcercasi, il grande concorso ispirato ai divertenti personaggi del film con Lodovica Comello (Gioia), Dexter (Paura), Tess Masazza (Disgusto), Diana Del Bufalo (tristezza), Frank Matano (Rabbia) è terminato ma continua a seguirci su:

Starring Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Willow Shields, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone, Natalie Dormer, with Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland.

The blockbuster Hunger Games franchise has taken audiences by storm around the world, grossing more than $2.2 billion at the global box office. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 now brings the franchise to its powerful final chapter in which Katniss Everdeen [Jennifer Lawrence] realizes the stakes are no longer just for survival – they are for the future.

With the nation of Panem in a full scale war, Katniss confronts President Snow [Donald Sutherland] in the final showdown. Teamed with a group of her closest friends – including Gale [Liam Hemsworth], Finnick [Sam Claflin], and Peeta [Josh Hutcherson] – Katniss goes off on a mission with the unit from District 13 as they risk their lives to liberate the citizens of Panem, and stage an assassination attempt on President Snow who has become increasingly obsessed with destroying her. The mortal traps, enemies, and moral choices that await Katniss will challenge her more than any arena she faced in The Hunger Games.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 is directed by Francis Lawrence from a screenplay by Peter Craig and Danny Strong and features an acclaimed cast including Academy Award®-winner Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Academy Award®-winner Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Willow Shields, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone with Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland reprising their original roles from The Hunger Games and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. The impressive lineup is joined by The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 co-stars Academy Award®-winner Julianne Moore, Mahershala Ali, Natalie Dormer, Wes Chatham, Elden Henson and Evan Ross.",2015-07-23T15:00:22Z,"['president snow', 'mockingjay', 'jennifer lawrence', 'philip seymour hoffman', 'the hunger games mockingjay part 1', 'peeta mellark', 'julianne moore', 'president coin', 'mockingjay trailer', 'official', 'josh hutcherson', 'liam hemsworth', 'district 13', 'the mockinjgay lives', 'new', 'lionsgate', 'jlaw', 'the hanging tree', 'mockingjay part 2', 'part 2', 'November', '2015', 'the hunger games', 'hunger games', 'preview', 'The Moking Jay', 'revolution', 'official trailer', 'trailer', 'theatrical trailer', 'We March Together']",22926381,146210,4159,13120,131634,0.5758314855875831

Starring Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Willow Shields, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone, Natalie Dormer, with Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland.

The blockbuster Hunger Games franchise has taken audiences by storm around the world, grossing more than $2.2 billion at the global box office. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 now brings the franchise to its powerful final chapter in which Katniss Everdeen [Jennifer Lawrence] realizes the stakes are no longer just for survival – they are for the future.

With the nation of Panem in a full scale war, Katniss confronts President Snow [Donald Sutherland] in the final showdown. Teamed with a group of her closest friends – including Gale [Liam Hemsworth], Finnick [Sam Claflin], and Peeta [Josh Hutcherson] – Katniss goes off on a mission with the unit from District 13 as they risk their lives to liberate the citizens of Panem, and stage an assassination attempt on President Snow who has become increasingly obsessed with destroying her. The mortal traps, enemies, and moral choices that await Katniss will challenge her more than any arena she faced in The Hunger Games.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 is directed by Francis Lawrence from a screenplay by Peter Craig and Danny Strong and features an acclaimed cast including Academy Award®-winner Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Academy Award®-winner Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Willow Shields, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone with Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland reprising their original roles from The Hunger Games and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.

Synopsis:
As kids in the 1980s, Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), Will Cooper (Kevin James), Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad), and Eddie “The Fire Blaster” Plant (Peter Dinklage) saved the world thousands of times – at 25 cents a game in the video arcades.  Now, they’re going to have to do it for real.  In Pixels, when intergalactic aliens discover video feeds of classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth, using the video games as the models for their assaults -- and now-U.S. President Cooper must call on his old-school arcade friends to save the world from being destroyed by PAC-MAN, Donkey Kong, Galaga, Centipede, and Space Invaders.  Joining them is Lt. Col. Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan), a specialist supplying the arcaders with unique weapons to fight the aliens.

Warner Bros. Pictures’ “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” is the second of five all new adventures in J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World™.  

At the end of the first film, the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) was captured by MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), with the help of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne).  But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escaped custody and has set about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings.  

In an effort to thwart Grindelwald’s plans, Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead.  Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.  

The film features an ensemble cast led by Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Ezra Miller, with Jude Law and Johnny Depp.  The cast also includes, Zoë Kravitz, Callum Turner, Claudia Kim, William Nadylam, Kevin Guthrie, Carmen Ejogo, and  Poppy Corby-Tuech.

“Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” is directed by David Yates, from a screenplay by J.K. Rowling.  The film is produced by David Heyman, J.K. Rowling, Steve Kloves and Lionel Wigram.  

Slated for release on November 16, 2018, the film will be distributed worldwide in 2D and 3D in select theatres and IMAX by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.",2018-07-21T17:56:04Z,"['fantastic beasts', 'fantastic beasts: the crimes of grindelwald', 'crimes of grindelwald', 'official teaser trailer', 'trailer', 'harry potter', 'jk rowling', 'j.k rowling', 'newt scamander', 'david yates', 'ezra miller', 'ron perlman', 'eddie redmayne', 'colin farrell', 'samantha morton', 'jon voight', 'dan fogler', 'johnny depp', 'gellert grindelwald', 'albus dumbledore', 'queenie', 'wizarding world', 'warner bros', 'wb', 'warner brothers']",13727626,157260,2459,10791,259316,0.2400358262427228

Auch Reichtum und Erfolg können ihm keine Garantie für ein langes, gesundes Leben bieten: Als der milliardenschwere Unternehmer Damian erfährt, dass er unheilbar an Krebs erkrankt ist, begibt er sich in die Hände einer geheimen Organisation unter der Leitung von Albright. Um seine Lebenszeit zu verlängern, lässt er sein Bewusstsein in einen anderen, jüngeren Körper übertragen. „Shedding“ nennt sich das ebenso geheime wie teure Verfahren. Das Experiment glückt und der wieder junge Damian beginnt unter seiner neuen Identität „Edward“ und in einer anderen Stadt, die gewonnene Zeit in vollen Zügen zu genießen. Doch die neue Welt bekommt Risse, als er von wirren Träumen geplagt wird – Erinnerungen an ein Leben, das nicht sein eigenes ist. Als Damian diesen Visionen  auf den Grund geht, muss er erneut um sein Leben fürchten, denn Albright und seine Organisation sind nicht bereit, ihr lukratives Geheimnis kampflos aufzugeben…

The modern world holds many secrets, but by far the most astounding is that witches still live among us; vicious supernatural creatures intent on unleashing the Black Death upon the world and putting an end to the human race once and for all. Armies of witch hunters have battled this unnatural enemy for centuries, including Kaulder, a valiant warrior who many years ago slayed the all-powerful WITCH QUEEN, decimating her followers in the process. In the moments right before her death, the Queen cursed KAULDER with immortality, forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter. Today, Kaulder is the last living hunter who has spent his immortal life tracking down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost family. However, unbeknownst to Kaulder, the Witch Queen has been resurrected and seeks revenge on her killer, leading to an epic battle that will determine the survival of mankind.

The modern world holds many secrets, but by far the most astounding is that witches still live among us; vicious supernatural creatures intent on unleashing the Black Death upon the world and putting an end to the human race once and for all. Armies of witch hunters have battled this unnatural enemy for centuries, including Kaulder, a valiant warrior who many years ago slayed the all-powerful WITCH QUEEN, decimating her followers in the process. In the moments right before her death, the Queen cursed KAULDER with immortality, forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter. Today, Kaulder is the last living hunter who has spent his immortal life tracking down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost family. However, unbeknownst to Kaulder, the Witch Queen has been resurrected and seeks revenge on her killer, leading to an epic battle that will determine the survival of mankind.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
A surprise attack in outer space forces the Enterprise to crash-land on a mysterious world. The assault came from Krall (Idris Elba), a lizard-like dictator who derives his energy by sucking the life out of his victims. Krall needs an ancient and valuable artifact that's aboard the badly damaged starship. Left stranded in a rugged wilderness, Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto) and the rest of the crew must now battle a deadly alien race while trying to find a way off their hostile planet.

http://blackmassthemovie.com

---
Three-time Oscar nominee Johnny Depp (“Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,” “Finding Neverland,” the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films) stars as notorious mobster Whitey Bulger in the drama “Black Mass,” directed by Scott Cooper (“Crazy Heart”).

The film also stars Joel Edgerton (“The Great Gatsby,” “Zero Dark Thirty”) as FBI Agent John Connolly; Oscar nominee Benedict Cumberbatch (“The Imitation Game”) as Whitey’s brother, Billy Bulger; Rory Cochrane (“Argo”) as Steve Flemmi, another member of the Irish mob; Jesse Plemons (TV’s “Fargo”) as Whitey’s longtime partner in crime, Kevin Weeks; and Kevin Bacon (“Crazy, Stupid, Love.” TV’s “The Following”) as FBI Agent Charles McGuire.

In 1970s South Boston, FBI Agent John Connolly (Edgerton) persuades Irish mobster James “Whitey” Bulger (Depp) to collaborate with the FBI and eliminate a common enemy: the Italian mob.  The drama tells the story of this unholy alliance, which spiraled out of control, allowing Whitey to evade law enforcement, consolidate power, and become one of the most ruthless and powerful gangsters in Boston history.

Cooper directed “Black Mass” from a screenplay by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth, based on the book by Dick Lehr and Gerard O’Neill.  John Lesher, Brian Oliver, Scott Cooper, Patrick McCormick and Tyler Thompson produced the film, with Brett Ratner, James Packer, Peter Mallouk, Ray Mallouk, Christopher Woodrow, Brett Granstaff, Gary Granstaff, Phil Hunt and Compton Ross serving as executive producers.  
The film also stars Dakota Johnson (“Fifty Shades of Grey”) as Lindsey Cyr, Whitey’s former girlfriend and mother of his only child; Julianne Nicholson (“August: Osage County”) as John Connolly’s wife, Marianne; and Adam Scott (ABC’s “Parks and Recreation”) as FBI Agent Robert Fitzpatrick.  Rounding out the main cast are David Harbour (“End of Watch”), Brad Carter (HBO’s “True Detective”), W Earl Brown (“Draft Day”) and Corey Stoll (“The Bourne Legacy”).

The behind-the-scenes creative team was led by director of photography Masanobu Takayanagi (“Silver Linings Playbook,” “Out of the Furnace”), production designer Stefania Cella (“The Great Beauty”), Oscar-nominated editor David Rosenbloom (“The Insider”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Foxcatcher”).  

Warner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Cross Creek Pictures and RatPac-Dune Entertainment, a Cross Creek Pictures Production in association with Le Grisbi Productions, Free State Pictures and Head Gear Films, a Scott Cooper Film, “Black Mass.”  Slated for release worldwide beginning September 18, 2015, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros.

The next generation of Griswolds is at it again. New Line Cinema’s “Vacation,” starring Ed Helms (“The Hangover” films) and Christina Applegate (the “Anchorman” films), takes the family on the road for another ill-fated adventure. The film marks Jonathan Goldstein & John Francis Daley’s directorial debut.

Following in his father’s footsteps and hoping for some much-needed family bonding, a grown-up Rusty Griswold (Helms) surprises his wife, Debbie (Applegate), and their two sons with a cross-country trip back to America’s “favorite family fun park,” Walley World.

Rounding out the cast are Leslie Mann (“The Other Woman”) as Rusty’s sister, Audrey; Skyler Gisondo (“Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,” “Hard Sell”) and Steele Stebbins (“A Haunted House 2”) as Rusty’s sons, James and Kevin; with Chris Hemsworth (the “Thor” films) in the role of Stone Crandall, Rusty’s irritatingly successful brother-in-law, Beverly D’Angelo and Chevy Chase as Ellen and Clark Griswold from the classic “Vacation” comedies.

Goldstein & Daley (“Horrible Bosses,” “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2”) wrote the script, based on characters created by John Hughes. David Dobkin (“The Judge,” “Wedding Crashers”) and Chris Bender (“We’re the Millers,” “Horrible Bosses 2”) are producing, with Marc S. Fischer, Jeff Kleeman, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Samuel J. Brown and Dave Neustadter serving as executive producers.

The directors’ behind-the-scenes creative team also includes director of photography Barry Peterson (the “Jump Street” films, “We’re the Millers”), production designer Barry Robison (“Wedding Crashers,” “Pitch Perfect”), Editor Jamie Gross and costume designer Debra McGuire (“Ted”). Music is by Mark Mothersbaugh.

At DC FanDome yesterday, we got the first trailer for ""Zack Snyder's Justice League"" and it was every bit as beautiful as you could possibly imagine. As a huge fan of Zack Snyder, the trailer, of course, inspired me. I just released a ""Watchmen"" trailer in the style of the Snyder Cut trailer so now it's time to make a ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" trailer in the same vein.

Directed by Jon Favreau (“Iron Man”), based on Rudyard Kipling’s timeless stories and inspired by Disney’s classic animated film, “The Jungle Book” is an all-new live-action epic adventure about Mowgli (newcomer Neel Sethi), a man-cub who’s been raised by a family of wolves. But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba), who bears the scars of Man, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he’s ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley), and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don’t exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire. The all-star cast also includes Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the fiercely protective mother wolf Raksha, and Giancarlo Esposito as the voice of wolf pack’s alpha male Akela. “The Jungle Book” seamlessly blends live-action with photorealistic CGI animals and environments, using up-to-the-minute technology and storytelling techniques to immerse audiences in an enchanting and lush world. The wild adventure swings into theaters in 3D on April 15, 2016.

Het verhaal speelt zich af in het begin van de jaren zestig op het hoogtepunt van de Koude Oorlog. De jarenlange vijanden CIA-agent Napoleon Solo (Cavill) en KGB-agent Illya Kuryakin (Hammer) worden gedwongen samen de strijd aan te binden met een mysterieuze, internationale misdaadorganisatie die door middel van kernwapens en technologie het wankele machtsevenwicht dreigt te verstoren. Met behulp van de dochter van een verdwenen Duitse wetenschapper probeert het duo te infiltreren in de misdaadorganisatie. Een race tegen de klok om de wereld te behoeden voor een ramp.

Situé au début des années 60, en pleine guerre froide, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. s'attache au parcours de l'agent de la CIA Solo et à l'agent du KGB Kuryakin. Contraints de laisser de côté leur antagonisme ancestral, les deux hommes s'engagent dans une mission conjointe : mettre hors d'état de nuire une organisation criminelle internationale déterminée à ébranler le fragile équilibre mondial, en favorisant la prolifération des armes et de la technologie nucléaires. Pour l'heure, Solo et Kuryakin n'ont qu'une piste : le contact de la fille d'un scientifique allemand porté disparu, le seul à même d'infiltrer l'organisation criminelle. Ils se lancent dans une course contre la montre pour retrouver sa trace et empêcher un cataclysme planétaire.",2015-08-06T13:26:25Z,"['Film (Media Genre)', 'trailer HD', '1080p', 'Henry Cavill (Award Winner)', 'Armie Hammer (Award Winner)', 'Hugh Grant (Celebrity)', 'Thriller (TV Genre)', 'Action Film (Film Genre)', 'Crime (TV Genre)', 'Crime Fiction (TV Genre)', 'Detective Fiction (TV Genre)', 'Official', 'Official Trailer', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer (Website Category)', 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.

ROOM tells the extraordinary story of Jack (Jacob Tremblay in a breakout performance), a spirited 5 year-old who is looked after by his loving and devoted Ma (Brie Larson, SHORT TERM 12, TRAINWRECK).  Like any good mother, Ma dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe, nurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things like playing games and telling stories. Their life, however, is anything but typical—they are trapped—confined to a windowless, 10-by-10-foot space, which Ma has euphemistically named “Room.” Ma has created a whole universe for Jack within Room, and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in this treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life.   But as Jack’s curiosity about their situation grows, and Ma’s resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan to escape, ultimately bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet: the real world.

From Oscar-winning director Robert Zemeckis (“Forrest Gump”) comes the fantasy adventure “Roald Dahl’s The Witches.”  The film stars Oscar winners Anne Hathaway (“Les Misérable,” “Ocean’s 8”) and Octavia Spencer (“The Help,” “The Shape of Water”), Oscar nominee Stanley Tucci (“The Hunger Games” films, “The Lovely Bones”), with Kristin Chenoweth (TV’s “Glee” and “BoJack Horseman”) and award-winning comedy legend Chris Rock.  Newcomer Jahzir Kadeem Bruno (TV’s “Atlanta”) also stars, alongside Codie-Lei Eastick (“Holmes & Watson”).

Reimagining Dahl’s beloved story for a modern audience, Zemeckis’s visually innovative film tells the darkly humorous and heartwarming tale of a young orphaned boy (Bruno) who, in late 1967, goes to live with his loving Grandma (Spencer) in the rural Alabama town of Demopolis.  As the boy and his grandmother encounter some deceptively glamorous but thoroughly diabolical witches, she wisely whisks our young hero away to an opulent seaside resort.  Regrettably, they arrive at precisely the same time that the world’s Grand High Witch (Hathaway) has gathered her fellow cronies from around the globe—undercover—to carry out her nefarious plans.

Based on the book by Roald Dahl, the screenplay is by Robert Zemeckis & Kenya Barris (TV’s “black-ish,” “Shaft”) and Oscar winner Guillermo del Toro (“The Shape of Water”).  Zemeckis is also producing, alongside Jack Rapke, del Toro, Alfonso Cuarón and Luke Kelly.  Serving as executive producers are Jacqueline Levine, Marianne Jenkins, Michael Siegel, Gideon Simeloff and Cate Adams.

The Story of N.W.A - In Theaters August 14th
http://www.straightouttacompton.com/

In the mid-1980s, the streets of Compton, California, were some of the most dangerous in the country.  When five young men translated their experiences growing up into brutally honest music that rebelled against abusive authority, they gave an explosive voice to a silenced generation.  Following the meteoric rise and fall of N.W.A., Straight Outta Compton tells the astonishing story of how these youngsters revolutionized music and pop culture forever the moment they told the world the truth about life in the hood and ignited a cultural war.

Starring O’Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell as Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy-E, Straight Outta Compton is directed by F. Gary Gray (Friday, Set It Off, The Italian Job).  The drama is produced by original N.W.A. members Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, who are joined by fellow producers Matt Alvarez and Tomica Woods-Wright.  Will Packer serves as executive producer of the film alongside Gray.",2015-02-09T03:20:25Z,"['NWA', 'Official Trailer', 'Straight Outta Compton', 'SOC', 'Outta Compton', 'Ice Cube (Musical Artist)', 'Dr. Dre (Music Video Performer)', 'F.

A mediados de los años ochenta del siglo pasado, las calles de Compton, California, se conocían por ser de las más peligrosas del país. Cinco jóvenes plasmaron lo que vivían a diario en un estilo de música de una honradez inmensa y, rebelándose contra el abuso de la autoridad, dieron voz a toda una generación hasta entonces silenciada.
A través del ascenso y de la caída meteórica de N.W.A., STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON cuenta la increíble historia de cinco jóvenes que cambiaron para siempre el escenario musical y la cultura pop a partir del momento en que contaron la verdad de lo que pasaba en su ciudad, dando pie a una guerra cultural.

Cinq jeunes gens ayant grandi au cœur de la violence des rues de Compton, dans la banlieue sud de Los Angeles, durant les années 70 et 80, forment un groupe de rap, exprimant leur rage et leur vécu dans une musique brutalement honnête et accusatrice des abus des représentants de l'autorité, et donnent la parole à toute une génération jusqu'alors contrainte au silence.

Retraçant l'ascension fulgurante et le déclin du groupe de rap N.W.A., STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON raconte l'étonnant parcours de ces jeunes qui ont révolutionné la musique et la culture populaire à tout jamais à l'instant même où ils ont levé le voile sur leurs conditions de vie dans les quartiers défavorisés des États-Unis, déclarant ainsi une véritable guerre culturelle.

JOY is the wild story of a family across four generations centered on the girl who becomes the woman who founds a business dynasty and becomes a matriarch in her own right.

JOY è la storia turbolenta di una donna e della sua famiglia attraverso quattro generazioni: dall’adolescenza alla maturità, fino alla costruzione di un impero imprenditoriale che sopravvive da decenni.
Tradimento, inganno, perdita dell'innocenza e pene d'amore sono gli ingredienti di questa intensa ed emozionante storia sul diventare punto di riferimento sia nella vita privata sia nell’ambito professionale, scontrandosi con un mondo del lavoro che non perdona. Gli alleati diventano nemici e i nemici diventano alleati,  sia dentro che fuori la famiglia, ma il lato più intimo di Joy e la sua fervida immaginazione la aiutano a superare i problemi con cui si dovrà scontrare.
Un film con Jennifer Lawrence, Rober De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Edgar Ramirez, Isabella Rossellini, Diane Ladd e Virginia Madsen. Come i precedenti film di David O. Russell, Joy sfida i generi per raccontare una storia di famiglia, lealtà e amore.

Director: David O. Russell
Cast: Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Edgar
Ramirez, Isabella Rossellini, Diane Ladd, Virginia Madsen.

Copenhagen, primi anni ‘20. L’artista danese Gerda Wegener dipinge un ritratto del marito Einar vestito da donna. Il dipinto raggiunge grande popolarità e Einar inizia a mantenere in modo permanente un’apparenza femminile, mutando il suo nome in Lili Elbe. Spinto da ideali femministi e supportato dalla moglie, Elbe tenta di effettuare il primo intervento per cambio di sesso da uomo a donna. L’intervento avrà grosse ripercussioni sul suo matrimonio e sulla sua identità.

Synopsis:
The Drac pack is back for an all-new monster comedy adventure in Sony Pictures Animation's Hotel Transylvania 2!  Everything seems to be changing for the better at Hotel Transylvania...  Dracula’s rigid monster-only hotel policy has finally relaxed, opening up its doors to human guests. But behind closed coffins, Drac is worried that his adorable half-human, half-vampire grandson, Dennis, isn’t showing signs of being a vampire. So while Mavis is busy visiting her human in-laws with Johnny – and in for a major cultural shock of her own – “Vampa” Drac enlists his friends Frank, Murray, Wayne and Griffin to put Dennis through a “monster-in-training” boot camp.  But little do they know that Drac’s grumpy and very old, old, old school dad Vlad is about to pay a family visit to the hotel.  And when Vlad finds out that his great-grandson is not a pure blood – and humans are now welcome at Hotel Transylvania – things are going to get batty!

Todo parece estar cambiando a mejor en el Hotel Transilvania... La rígida política de “sólo para monstruos” establecida por Drácula para el hotel, se ha relajado por fin y se han abierto las puertas también a huéspedes humanos. Pero, de ataúdes para dentro, Drácula está preocupado al ver que su adorable nieto Dennis, medio humano y medio vampiro, no muestra signos de ser vampiro. Así que mientras Mavis está ocupada visitando a sus suegros humanos en compañía de Johny – e inmersa ella misma en su propio choque cultural – el abuelito Drácula recluta a sus amigos Frank, Murray, Wayne y Griffin para hacer que Dennis pase por un campamento de “entrenamiento de monstruos”. Lo que ellos no saben es que el gruñón, y de la muy, muy, muy vieja guardia, padre de Drácula, Vlad, está a punto de visitar a la familia en el hotel. Y cuando Vlad descubra que su bisnieto no es de sangre pura – y que los humanos también son ahora bienvenidos en el Hotel Transilvania – las cosas se van a poner complicadas.

El extraordinario elenco que una vez más se reúne para esta nueva aventura de los monstruos más simpáticos del cine, Santiago Segura, Clara Lago, Dani Martínez, Alaska y Mario Vaquerizo, a quienes se une además un ilustre actor de la escena española, Arturo Fernández, tenemos el enorme placer de poner a vuestra disposición el tráiler final de HOTEL TRANSILVANIA 2, de Sony Pictures Animation! … Que llegará a los cines de toda España el próximo 23 de octubre para hacernos temblar… de risas.

David F. Sandberg (“Annabelle: Creation”) directs New Line Cinema’s “Shazam!,” the origin story that stars Zachary Levi (TV’s “Chuck”) as the titular DC Super Hero, along with Asher Angel (TV’s “Andi Mack”) as Billy Batson, and Mark Strong (the “Kingsman” movies) in the role of Super-Villain Dr. Thaddeus Sivana.  Peter Safran (“Aquaman,” “The Conjuring” and “Annabelle” films) serves as the film’s producer.

We all have a superhero inside us, it just takes a bit of magic to bring it out.  In Billy Batson’s (Angel) case, by shouting out one word—SHAZAM!—this streetwise 14-year-old foster kid can turn into the adult Super Hero Shazam (Levi), courtesy of an ancient wizard.  Still a kid at heart—inside a ripped, godlike body—Shazam revels in this adult version of himself by doing what any teen would do with superpowers: have fun with them!  Can he fly?  Does he have X-ray vision?  Can he shoot lightning out of his hands?  Can he skip his social studies test?  Shazam sets out to test the limits of his abilities with the joyful recklessness of a child.  But he’ll need to master these powers quickly in order to fight the deadly forces of evil controlled by Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Strong).

“Shazam!” also stars Jack Dylan Grazer (“IT”) as Billy’s best friend and ultimate superhero enthusiast, Freddy, part of the foster family that includes Mary, played by Grace Fulton (“Annabelle: Creation”); Darla, played by Faithe Herman (TV’s “This is Us”); Eugene, played by Ian Chen (TV’s “Fresh Off the Boat”); and Pedro, played by Jovan Armand (TV’s “Hawaii Five-O”).  Cooper Andrews (TV’s “The Walking Dead”) and Marta Milans (TV’s “Killer Women”) play foster parents Victor and Rosa Vasquez, with Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou (“Blood Diamond”) as the Wizard.

Firmly set in the DC universe but with his own distinctly fun, family-centric tone, the screenplay is by Henry Gayden, story by Gayden and Darren Lemke.  Shazam was created by Bill Parker and C.C. Beck.  Christopher Godsick, Jeffrey Chernov, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia serve as executive producers.

Sandberg’s creative team includes his “Annabelle: Creation” director of photography Maxime Alexandre, production designer Jennifer Spence, editor Michel Aller and costume designer Leah Butler.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and director James Wan comes an action-packed adventure that spans the vast, visually breathtaking underwater world of the seven seas, “Aquaman,” starring Jason Momoa in the title role.  The film reveals the origin story of half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime—one that will not only force him to face who he really is, but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be…a king.

The film also stars Amber Heard (“Justice League,” “Magic Mike XXL”) as Mera, a fierce warrior and Aquaman’s ally throughout his journey; Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (“Platoon,” “Spider-Man 2”) as Vulko, council to the Atlantean throne; Patrick Wilson (“The Conjuring” films, “Watchmen”) as Orm/Ocean Master, the present King of Atlantis; Dolph Lundgren (“The Expendables” films) as Nereus, King of the Atlantean tribe Xebel; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Netflix’s “The Get Down”) as the vengeful Black Manta; and Oscar winner Nicole Kidman (“The Hours,” “Lion”) as Arthur’s mom, Atlanna; as well as Ludi Lin (“Power Rangers”) as Captain Murk, Atlantean Commando; and Temuera Morrison (“Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones,” “Green Lantern”) as Arthur’s dad, Tom Curry.

Wan directs from a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (“The Conjuring 2”) and Will Beall (“Gangster Squad,” TV’s “Training Day”), story by Geoff Johns & James Wan and Will Beall, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger.  The film is produced by Peter Safran and Rob Cowan, with Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Jon Berg, Geoff Johns and Walter Hamada serving as executive producers.

Wan’s team behind the scenes includes such frequent collaborators as Oscar-nominated director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2,” “Forrest Gump”), his five-time editor Kirk Morri (“The Conjuring” films, “Furious 7,” the “Insidious” films), and production designer Bill Brzeski (“Furious 7”).  They are joined by costume designer Kym Barrett (“The Matrix” trilogy, “The Amazing Spider-Man”) and composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”).

Warner Bros. Pictures Presents a Safran Company Production, a James Wan Film, “Aquaman.”  The film is set to hit theaters on December 21, 2018, in 3D and 2D and IMAX, and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and director James Wan comes an action-packed adventure that spans the vast, visually breathtaking underwater world of the seven seas, “Aquaman,” starring Jason Momoa in the title role.  The film reveals the origin story of half-human, half-Atlantean Arthur Curry and takes him on the journey of his lifetime—one that will not only force him to face who he really is, but to discover if he is worthy of who he was born to be…a king.

The film also stars Amber Heard (“Justice League,” “Magic Mike XXL”) as Mera, a fierce warrior and Aquaman’s ally throughout his journey; Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe (“Platoon,” “Spider-Man 2”) as Vulko, council to the Atlantean throne; Patrick Wilson (“The Conjuring” films, “Watchmen”) as Orm/Ocean Master, the present King of Atlantis; Dolph Lundgren (“The Expendables” films) as Nereus, King of the Atlantean tribe Xebel; Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Netflix’s “The Get Down”) as the vengeful Black Manta; and Oscar winner Nicole Kidman (“The Hours,” “Lion”) as Arthur’s mom, Atlanna; as well as Ludi Lin (“Power Rangers”) as Captain Murk, Atlantean Commando; and Temuera Morrison (“Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones,” “Green Lantern”) as Arthur’s dad, Tom Curry.

Wan directs from a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (“The Conjuring 2”) and Will Beall (“Gangster Squad,” TV’s “Training Day”), story by Geoff Johns & James Wan and Will Beall, based on characters from DC, Aquaman created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger.  The film is produced by Peter Safran and Rob Cowan, with Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Jon Berg, Geoff Johns and Walter Hamada serving as executive producers.

Wan’s team behind the scenes includes such frequent collaborators as Oscar-nominated director of photography Don Burgess (“The Conjuring 2,” “Forrest Gump”), his five-time editor Kirk Morri (“The Conjuring” films, “Furious 7,” the “Insidious” films), and production designer Bill Brzeski (“Furious 7”).  They are joined by costume designer Kym Barrett (“The Matrix” trilogy, “The Amazing Spider-Man”) and composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (“Wonder Woman”).

From Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema comes award-winning filmmaker Ryan Coogler’s “Creed.”  The film explores a new chapter in the “Rocky” story and stars Academy Award nominee Sylvester Stallone in his iconic role.  The film also reunites Coogler with his “Fruitvale Station” star Michael B. Jordan as the son of Apollo Creed.

Adonis Johnson (Jordan) never knew his famous father, world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, who died before he was born.  Still, there’s no denying that boxing is in his blood, so Adonis heads to Philadelphia, the site of Apollo Creed’s legendary match with a tough upstart named Rocky Balboa.

Once in the City of Brotherly Love, Adonis tracks Rocky (Stallone) down and asks him to be his trainer.  Despite his insistence that he is out of the fight game for good, Rocky sees in Adonis the strength and determination he had known in Apollo—the fierce rival who became his closest friend.  Agreeing to take him on, Rocky trains the young fighter, even as the former champ is battling an opponent more deadly than any he faced in the ring. 

With Rocky in his corner, it isn’t long before Adonis gets his own shot at the title…but can he develop not only the drive but also the heart of a true fighter, in time to get into the ring?

“Creed” also stars Tessa Thompson (“Selma,” “Dear White People”) as Bianca, a local singer-songwriter who becomes involved with Adonis; Phylicia Rashad (Lifetime’s “Steel Magnolias”) as Mary Anne Creed, Apollo’s widow; and English pro boxer and former three-time ABA Heavyweight Champion Anthony Bellew as boxing champ “Pretty” Ricky Conlan.

Coogler directs from a screenplay he wrote with Aaron Covington, based on characters from the “Rocky” series written by Sylvester Stallone.  The film is being produced by Robert Chartoff, Irwin Winkler, Charles Winkler, William Chartoff, David Winkler, Kevin King Templeton and Sylvester Stallone, with Nicholas Stern executive producing.

Joining Coogler behind the scenes are director of photography Maryse Alberti (“The Wrestler”) and costume designers Antoinette Messam (“Orphan”) and Emma Potts (“127 Hours”), as well as his “Fruitvale Station” team: editors Michael P. Shawver and Claudia Castello; production designer Hannah Beachler; and composer Ludwig Göransson.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures present, in association with New Line Cinema, a Chartoff Winkler Production, “Creed.”  Opening on November 25, 2015, the film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, with select international territories as well as all television distribution being handled by MGM.",2015-06-30T23:30:19Z,"['creed', 'creed movie', 'creed trailer', 'creed movie trailer', 'michael b. jordan', 'ryan coogler', 'sylvester stallone', 'rocky', 'rocky movie', 'rocky movie trailer', 'tessa thompson', 'anthony bellew', 'boxing movie', 'boxing', 'gabriel rosado', 'phylicia rashad']",26184663,132880,3612,10392,312221,0.4244623655913978

Life has become a balancing act for Adonis Creed. Between personal obligations and training for his next big fight, he is up against the challenge of his life. Facing an opponent with ties to his family’s past only intensifies his impending battle in the ring. Rocky Balboa is there by his side through it all and, together, Rocky and Adonis will confront their shared legacy, question what’s worth fighting for, and discover that nothing’s more important than family. Creed II is about going back to basics to rediscover what made you a champion in the first place, and remembering that, no matter where you go, you can’t escape your history.

New York im Jahr 2005: Der Dollar ist stark, die Wirtschaft boomt. An der Wall Street werden jeden Tag aufs Neue Börsen- und Wertpapiergeschäfte in gigantischem Umfang getätigt. Mit immer komplexer werdenden Immobilienprodukten, hervorragenden Renditen und vermeintlich minimalem Risiko werden selbst Arbeitslose zu Villenbesitzern und den Maklern, Versicherern und Bankenbossen winkt das schnelle Geld.  
Was die Finanzbosse, die Medien und die Regierung nicht erkennen, durchschaut der eigenwillige Hedgefonds-Manager Michael Burry (Christian Bale) sofort: Er prognostiziert schon in wenigen Jahren das Platzen der amerikanischen Immobilienblase und den daraus resultierenden Zusammenbruch der Weltwirtschaft, der Millionen Menschen heimat- und arbeitslos machen wird. Als Burry vor der großen Katastrophe warnt, will niemand auf ihn hören – zu sicher fühlen sich die Bankenbosse und tun seine Prognosen ab. Daraufhin entwickelt Burry einen perfiden Plan: den „Big Short“. Durch sogenannte „Shortings“, Leerkäufe von Aktien großer Investmentbanken, wettet er gemeinsam mit weiteren risikofreudigen Spekulanten, wie dem unbeirrbaren Trader Steve Eisman (Steve Carell), dem geldgierigen Deutsche-Bank-Makler Greg Lippmann (Ryan Gosling) und dem früheren Star-Investor Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), gegen das Finanzsystem, um selbst das unfassbar große Geld zu machen. Das Desaster und der absolute Wahnsinn jenseits aller moralischen Grenzen hat begonnen … 

So sexy war die Wall Street noch nie! Mit THE BIG SHORT kommt ein packender und bis in die Nebenrollen hochkarätig besetzter Finanzthriller in die deutschen Kinos, der eindrucksvoll und dabei äußerst unterhaltsam einen Blick hinter die Kulissen der heimlichen Machtzentrale der Welt wirft. Die Besetzung liest sich wie das ‚Who is Who‘ Hollywoods: Brad Pitt („Inglorious Basterds“, „World War Z“), Christian Bale („The Dark Knight Rises“, „American Hustle“), Ryan Gosling („Drive“, „The Place Beyond the Pines“), Steve Carell („Foxcatcher“, „Anchorman – Die Legende kehrt zurück“) und Marisa Tomei („Der Mandant“, „The Wrestler – Ruhm, Liebe Schmerz“) brillieren in dieser wahren Geschichte um Gier, Betrug, Zynismus und das skrupellose Spiel mit Macht und Geld. THE BIG SHORT beruht auf dem gleichnamigen Bestseller von Michael Lewis („Die Kunst zu gewinnen – Moneyball“, „Blind Side – Die große Chance“), der damit eine Finanztragödie thematisiert, von der unzählige Menschen direkt betroffen waren und unter deren Folgen sie bis heute leiden – nicht nur in den USA, sondern weltweit. Inszeniert hat die schonungslose Adaption Autor und Regisseur Adam McKay („Saturday Night Live“, „Anchorman“ 1 und 2).  Nicht zuletzt wegen des hochkarätigen Casts gilt THE BIG SHORT bereits jetzt als ein absolutes Kino-Highlight des kommenden Jahres und zählt zu den großen Oscar®-Favoriten 2016.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In 2008, Wall Street guru Michael Burry realizes that a number of subprime home loans are in danger of defaulting. Burry bets against the housing market by throwing more than $1 billion of his investors' money into credit default swaps. His actions attract the attention of banker Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), hedge-fund specialist Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and other greedy opportunists. Together, these men make a fortune by taking full advantage of the impending economic collapse in America.

There’s a right way to be single, a wrong way to be single, and then…there’s Alice.  And Robin.  Lucy.  Meg.  Tom.  David.  New York City is full of lonely hearts seeking the right match, be it a love connection, a hook-up, or something in the middle.  And somewhere between the teasing texts and one-night stands, what these unmarrieds all have in common is the need to learn how to be single in a world filled with ever-evolving definitions of love.  Sleeping around in the city that never sleeps was never so much fun.

Christian Ditter (“Love, Rosie,” “The Crocodiles”) directed the comedy from a screenplay by Abby Kohn & Marc Silverstein (“The Vow,” “He’s Just Not That Into You”) and Dana Fox (“Couples Retreat,” “What Happens in Vegas”), screen story by Kohn & Silverstein, based on the book by Liz Tucillo (TV’s “Sex & the City,” He’s Just Not That Into You).  John Rickard and Fox are producing the film.  Marcus Viscidi, Richard Brener, Michael Disco, Dave Neustadter, Michele Weiss, Drew Barrymore and Nancy Juvonen are executive producers.

Ditters’ behind-the-scenes creative team is headed by his frequent collaborator, director of photography Christian Rein, as well as production designer Steve Saklad (“Juno,” “Up in the Air”), editor Tia Nolan (“Friends with Benefits”) and costume designer Leah Katznelson (“Enough Said,” “21 Jump Street”).  The music is by Fil Eisler (FOX TV’s “Empire”).

Hosted by Andy Goldenberg

TRANSCRIPTION

Hi, my name is Andy Goldenberg and I am the Trailerist.

Tonight, we discover How to Be Single. 

CUE: How to be Single LOGO

I’ll give you some free tips on the house. How to be single.

Eat a lot of garlic and onions.

When you kiss, really get in there with your tongue like you’re a dog who hasn’t seen their owner in a day and a half.  

Have sex with your girlfriend’s best friend.

If you’re a guy, wear jean shorts. 

CUE: “”I know breaking up sucks. But you know what’s worse, wasting a night in New York City.”

You know what’s also bad? Being homeless. Starving on the street. Losing everything. But, you know… it’s all relative. Breaking up also is very, very bad in the scheme of things.

Gentlemen: Go see this movie. Ladies are giving you their secret playbook for free. 

Rule #1: They’re using you.

CUE: With his sausage wallet.

Never whip out your sausage wallet. Pay with cash. 

Rule #2: Have pre-determined limits.

CUE: TOTAL # OF DRINKS

According to conventional wisdom, your blood alcohol content level will remain within a safe .08 if you consume one drink per hour. Over .08 and you experience dramatic mood swings, slurred speech, and unsound judgement. In other words, she’d rather die than have sex with you. 

Ugh. Girls can be so mean. 

CUE: You have too much hair.

Girls. Your biggest enemies are your friends. They’re reading Cosmopolitan magazines and watching movies about HOW TO date. And that’s why dating is hard. Because you’re not just being yourself. You’re bullied into following outdated rules like this:

CUE: TITPUNCH

But, seriously, if you do text me back right away, I’ll think you have no life and that you’re way too into me. Give me some breathing space, stalker.

How to be Single goes steady on February 12 days just in time for you to practice for Valentine’s Day.  Do you follow these rules? Let me know in the comments below! Are you ever excited for Valentine’s Day? Like this video. And subscribe to the Trailerist to see more teasers, trailers, and previews. To be continued…

Jason Kelly [Zac Efron] is one week away from marrying his boss’s uber-controlling daughter, putting him on the fast track for a partnership at the law firm. However, when the straight-laced Jason is tricked into driving his foul-mouthed grandfather, Dick [Robert De Niro], to Daytona for spring break, his pending nuptials are suddenly in jeopardy. Between riotous frat parties, bar fights, and an epic night of karaoke, Dick is on a quest to live his life to the fullest and bring Jason along for the ride. Ultimately, on the wildest journey of their lives, “dirty” Grandpa and his uptight grandson discover they can learn from one another and form the bond they never had.

Often times you find love where you least expect it.  Sometimes it takes you where you never expected to go…

Louisa “Lou” Clark (Clarke) lives in a quaint town in the English countryside.  With no clear direction in her life, the quirky and creative 26-year-old goes from one job to the next in order to help her tight-knit family make ends meet.   

Her normally cheery outlook is put to the test, however, when she faces her newest career challenge. Taking a job at the local “castle,” she becomes caregiver and companion to Will Traynor (Claflin), a wealthy young banker who became wheelchair bound in an accident two years prior, and whose whole world changed dramatically in the blink of an eye.  No longer the adventurous soul he once was, the now cynical Will has all but given up.  That is until Lou determines to show him that life is worth living.  Embarking together on a series of adventures, both Lou and Will get more than they bargained for, and find their lives—and hearts—changing in ways neither one could have imagined.

But what starts out as the most protected event on earth, turns into a deadly plot to kill the world's most powerful leaders, devastate every known landmark in the British capital, and unleash a terrifying vision of the future. Only three people have any hope of stopping it: the President of the United States, his formidable secret service head (Gerard Butler), and an English MI-6 agent who rightly trusts no one.

The modern mammal metropolis of Zootopia is a city like no other. Comprised of habitat neighborhoods like ritzy Sahara Square and frigid Tundratown, it’s a melting pot where animals from every environment live together—a place where no matter what you are, from the biggest elephant to the smallest shrew, you can be anything. But when rookie Officer Judy Hopps (voice of Ginnifer Goodwin) arrives, she discovers that being the first bunny on a police force of big, tough animals isn’t so easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a case, even if it means partnering with a fast-talking, scam-artist fox, Nick Wilde (voice of Jason Bateman), to solve the mystery. Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Zootopia,” a comedy-adventure directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore and co-directed by Jared Bush, opens in theaters on March 4, 2016.

Zootopia Official Teaser Trailer #1 (2016) - Disney Animated Movie HD

The modern mammal metropolis of Zootopia is a city like no other. Comprised of habitat neighborhoods like ritzy Sahara Square and frigid Tundratown, it’s a melting pot where animals from every environment live together—a place where no matter what you are, from the biggest elephant to the smallest shrew, you can be anything. But when optimistic Officer Judy Hopps arrives, she discovers that being the first bunny on a police force of big, tough animals isn’t so easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a case, even if it means partnering with a fast-talking, scam-artist fox, Nick Wilde, to solve the mystery. Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Zootopia,” a comedy-adventure directed by Byron Howard (“Tangled,” “Bolt”) and Rich Moore (“Wreck-It Ralph,” “The Simpsons”) and co-directed by Jared Bush (“Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero”), opens in theaters on March 4, 2016.

Met The Neon Demon vertelt Nicolas Winding Refn een horrorsprookje waarin schoonheid en obsessie een aantrekkelijke, maar verraderlijke cocktail opleveren. Het jonge, ambitieuze model Jesse verhuist naar Los Angeles en weet alle aandacht op zich te vestigen. Haar schoonheid en vitaliteit worden verslonden door de gevestigde modellen, die koste wat het kost willen wat Jesse heeft. Na Drive (waarvoor Refn genomineerd werd voor een Oscar®) en Only God Forgives komt de regisseur opnieuw met een unieke film die genregrenzen opzoekt en nog lang nazindert. In Elle Fanning vindt Refn een nieuwe muze. Naast haar zien we Abbey Lee, Keanu Reeves en Christina Hendricks. Als het om schoonheid gaat is niemand te vertrouwen. Beauty isn’t everything. It’s the only thing.",2016-07-07T07:06:21Z,"['horror', 'trailer', 'The Neon Demon', 'Nicolas Winding Refn']",647,2,0,0,301365,0.3116883116883117

Chris Hemsworth and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron return to their roles from Snow White and the Huntsman, joined by Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain.

Theron stars as evil Queen Ravenna, who betrays her good sister Freya (Blunt) with an unforgivable act, freezing Freya’s heart to love and unleashing in her an icy power she never knew she possessed.  Retreating to a kingdom far to the north, Freya raises an army of Huntsmen as her protectors, with the only rule that no two of them should ever fall in love.

As a war for domination escalates between the two queens, the hero standing between them is Freya’s most elite Huntsman, Eric (Hemsworth).  Alongside fellow warrior Sara (Chastain)—the only woman who has ever captured his heart—Eric must help Freya vanquish her sister…or Ravenna’s wickedness will rule for eternity.

Yea, so I first started working on this before the movie came out, but the life kind of got in the way and I didn’t have the time to work on it. Then I saw the movie and LOVED IT! So I got really inspired to work on it again. (PS. If you haven’t already, go see it! Its such an awesome movie and the ending was so cute!) Hehe no spoilers tho ;)
And thank you to everyone who’s maskings I used! Especially Hiccup, cause when I mask him he looks like a potato/blob xP

But yea, I know there is like a bunch of other non/disney trailers for this movie with the same characters and all, but I hope you still enjoy this one as much as I enjoyed making it :D

Returning stars Seth Rogen, Zac Efron and Rose Byrne are joined by Chloë Grace Moretz for Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, the follow-up to 2014’s most popular original comedy.  Nicholas Stoller again directs in a film that follows what happens when the will of parenthood goes against the bonds of sisterhood. 

Now that Mac (Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Byrne) have a second baby on the way, they are ready to make the final move into adulthood: the suburbs.  But just as they thought they’d reclaimed the neighborhood and were safe to sell, they learn that the new occupants next door are a sorority even more out of control than Teddy (Efron) and his brothers ever dreamed of being.

Tired of their school’s sexist, restrictive system, the unorthodox ladies of Kappa Nu have decided to start a house where they can do whatever the hell they want.  When Shelby (Moretz) and her sisters, Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein), find the perfect place just off campus, they won’t let the fact that it’s located on a quiet street stand in their way of parties as epic as the guys throw.

Forced to turn to the one ex-neighbor with the skills to bring down the new Greeks next door, the Radners—alongside best friends Jimmy (Ike Barinholtz) and Paula (Carla Gallo)—bring in charismatic Teddy as their secret weapon.  If he can infiltrate the sorority and charm his way through it, the thirtysomethings will shutter the Kappas’ home.  But if they think that their neighbors are going down without a fight, they have severely underestimated the power of youthful ingenuity and straight-up crazy.
