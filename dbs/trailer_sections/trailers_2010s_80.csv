Før Charles Xavier og Erik Lensherr tog navnene Professor X og Magneto, var de to unge mænd, som opdagede deres kræfter for første gang. Før de blev ærkefjender, var de bedste venner, og de arbejdede sammen med andre mutanter (nogle velkendte, nogle nye) for at stoppe den største trussel verden nogensinde har kendt. I denne proces opstod en alvorlig splittelse mellem dem, hvilket var begyndelsen på den evige krig mellem Magnetos broderskab og Professor X' X-men. .

But when a new enemy called Parallax threatens to destroy the balance of power in the Universe, their fate and the fate of Earth lie in the hands of their newest recruit, the first human ever selected: Hal Jordan.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A cocky pilot (Ryan Reynolds) joins an intergalactic legion of superpower-wielding peace keepers.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In a universe as vast as it is mysterious, a small but powerful force has existed for centuries. Protectors of peace and justice, they are called the Green Lantern Corps. A brotherhood of warriors sworn to keep intergalactic order, each Green Lantern wears a ring that grants him superpowers. But when a new enemy called Parallax threatens to destroy the balance of power in the Universe, their fate and the fate of Earth lie in the hands of their newest recruit, the first human ever selected: Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds). Hal is a gifted and cocky test pilot, but the Green Lanterns have little respect for humans, who have never harnessed the infinite powers of the ring before. -

Manchen Lehrern ist alles sch…egal. Elizabeth zum Beispiel. Sie hat ein loses Mundwerk, kennt keine Skrupel und ist für ihren Beruf völlig ungeeignet. Sie trinkt, ist meistens high und kann es kaum erwarten, sich nach oben zu schlafen und einen reichen Sugar Daddy zu heiraten, damit sie endlich ihren lästigen Tagesjob hinschmeißen kann, bei dem sie allen ohnehin nur etwas vorgaukelt. Als ihr Verlobter sie sitzen lässt, wirft Elizabeth ein Auge auf einen ebenso vermögenden wie attraktiven jungen Vertretungslehrer. Allerdings muss sie um dessen Aufmerksamkeit mit Amy, einer bei allen sehr beliebten Kollegin, buhlen. Gleichzeitig muss Elizabeth die hartnäckigen Avancen eines sarkastischen und überaus respektlosen Sportlehrers abwehren. Die Folgen von Elizabeths hemmungslosen und skandalträchtigen Intrigen sorgen dafür, dass ihre Schüler und Kollegen, sowie nicht zuletzt sie selbst, einige Lektionen fürs Leben lernen, die sich gewaschen haben.

https://twitter.com/HorribleBosses

The follow-up to the 2011 hit comedy ""Horrible Bosses"" reunites Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis as everyone's favorite working stiffs: Nick, Dale and Kurt. 

Jennifer Aniston (""We're the Millers""), and Oscar® winners Jamie Foxx (""Ray"") and Kevin Spacey (""American Beauty,"" ""The Usual Suspects"") also reprise their ""Horrible Bosses"" starring roles, while Chris Pine (""Star Trek: Into Darkness"") and Oscar® winner Christoph Waltz (""Django Unchained,"" ""Inglourious Basterds"") star as new adversaries standing between the guys and their dreams of success.

Fed up with answering to higher-ups, Nick (Bateman), Dale (Day) and Kurt (Sudeikis) decide to become their own bosses by launching their own business in ""Horrible Bosses 2.""  But a slick investor soon pulls the rug out from under them.  Outplayed and desperate, and with no legal recourse, the three would-be entrepreneurs hatch a misguided plan to kidnap the investor's adult son and ransom him to regain control of their company.  

""Horrible Bosses 2"" was directed by Sean Anders and produced by Brett Ratner, Jay Stern, Chris Bender, John Rickard and John Morris.  Serving as executive producers were Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Michael Disco, Samuel J. Brown, John Cheng and Diana Pokorny.  The screenplay was written by Sean Anders & John Morris (""We're the Millers""), story by Jonathan Goldstein & John Francis Daley and Sean Anders & John Morris, based on characters created by Michael Markowitz.  The music is composed by Christopher Lennertz (""Horrible Bosses""). 

The behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Julio Macat (""Pitch Perfect""), production designer Clayton Hartley (""We're the Millers""), editor Eric Kissack (""The Dictator""), and costume designer Carol Ramsey (""Identity Thief""). 

A New Line Cinema Presentation, a Benderspink/RatPac Entertainment Production, ""Horrible Bosses 2"" is set to open beginning November 26, 2014.  It will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.

The follow-up to the 2011 hit comedy ""Horrible Bosses"" reunites Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis as everyone's favorite working stiffs: Nick, Dale and Kurt. 

Jennifer Aniston (""We're the Millers""), and Oscar® winners Jamie Foxx (""Ray"") and Kevin Spacey (""American Beauty,"" ""The Usual Suspects"") also reprise their ""Horrible Bosses"" starring roles, while Chris Pine (""Star Trek: Into Darkness"") and Oscar® winner Christoph Waltz (""Django Unchained,"" ""Inglourious Basterds"") star as new adversaries standing between the guys and their dreams of success.

Fed up with answering to higher-ups, Nick (Bateman), Dale (Day) and Kurt (Sudeikis) decide to become their own bosses by launching their own business in ""Horrible Bosses 2.""  But a slick investor soon pulls the rug out from under them.  Outplayed and desperate, and with no legal recourse, the three would-be entrepreneurs hatch a misguided plan to kidnap the investor's adult son and ransom him to regain control of their company.  

""Horrible Bosses 2"" was directed by Sean Anders and produced by Brett Ratner, Jay Stern, Chris Bender, John Rickard and John Morris.  Serving as executive producers were Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Michael Disco, Samuel J. Brown, John Cheng and Diana Pokorny.  The screenplay was written by Sean Anders & John Morris (""We're the Millers""), story by Jonathan Goldstein & John Francis Daley and Sean Anders & John Morris, based on characters created by Michael Markowitz.  The music is composed by Christopher Lennertz (""Horrible Bosses""). 

The behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Julio Macat (""Pitch Perfect""), production designer Clayton Hartley (""We're the Millers""), editor Eric Kissack (""The Dictator""), and costume designer Carol Ramsey (""Identity Thief""). 

A New Line Cinema Presentation, a Benderspink/RatPac Entertainment Production, ""Horrible Bosses 2"" is set to open beginning November 26, 2014.  It will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.

Quitting is not an option, so, with the benefit of a few-too-many drinks and some dubious advice from a hustling ex-con, the three friends devise a convulated and seemingly foolproof plan to rid themselves of their respective employers... permanently.  There's only one problem:  even the best laid plans are only as foolproof as the brains behind them.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I hits theaters on November 19th, 2010.

Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felton, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy, Jamie Campbell Bower, Bonnie Wright, Helena Bonham Carter, Timothy Spall, Michael Gambon, Rhys Ifans, Maggie Smith, John Hurt, Jason Isaacs, Ciaran Hind

Part 1 begins as Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort's immortality and destruction-the Horcruxes. On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart.

Meanwhile, the wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort... alive.

Harry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale-the legend of the Deathly Hallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks.

Little does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became ""the Boy Who Lived."" No longer just a boy, Harry Potter is drawing ever closer to the task for which he has been preparing since the day he first stepped into Hogwarts: the ultimate battle with Voldemort.

Cal Weaver este casatorit cu iubita lui din perioada liceului, are doi copii reusiti pe nume Hannah si Robbie, o casa frumoasa si un serviciu la care merge cu placere, motiv pentru care se considera implinit atat din punct de vedere familial, cat si din punct de vedere profesional. Atunci cand afla ca sotia sa Emily ii este infidela si vrea sa divorteze de el, barbatul simte ca viata lui aparent perfecta se destrama si incepe sa-si petreaca serile libere intr-un bar local. Luat sub aripa ocrotitoare de catre playboy-ul Jacob Palmer, Cal este invatat cum sa se imbrace si cum sa flirteze cu femeile si in scurta vreme incepe sa aiba succes la reprezentantele sexului opus, chiar daca nu a mai iesit la intalniri romantice de aproximativ doua decenii. Numai ca stilul de viata rafinat pe care il deprinde de la tanarul sau mentor nu ii confera satisfactiile pe care i se oferea in trecut familia, iar Cal tanjeste in continuare dupa Emily si dupa beneficiile casniciei, sperand sa o recucereasca pe nevasta care l-a parasit. Intre timp, Jacob Palmer se indragosteste de Hannah, iar adolescentul Robbie este innebunit dupa bona lui Jessica Riley, care a dezvoltat insa o pasiune pentru tatal sau.",2011-10-04T19:50:22Z,"['Film Crazy', 'Stupid', 'Love.

ueBcBWrwR0o,ONE DAY | Official International Trailer (2016),GDH,UC_rENyV7n1gtp6pPKpvuXGg,"ONE DAY is the first film of ""GDH""
Director : Bangjong Pisanthanakun [Shutter (2004), Hello Stranger (2010), Pee Mak (2013) etc.]
Cast : Chantavit Dhanasevi (Ter), Nittha Jirayungyurn (Mew)

Synopsis :

Would being in love for one day...be enough?

‘Denchai’ (Ter - Chantavit Dhanasevi) is a geeky 30-year-old IT officer whose existence is only acknowledged when his colleagues need tech support. He feels even more of an outcast every time his co-workers call on him for help and can’t even remember his name. 

Denchai’s mundane world is flipped upside down when he goes to fix a printer for a new girl in the Marketing department named ‘Nui’ (Mew - Nittha Jirayungyurn). Nui happens to get his name correct, making him feel valued once again. From that heartfelt moment, Denchai falls head over heels for Nui, but only admires her secretly from afar, since he wholeheartedly knows that Nui is completely out of his league.

It’s not until one day when their company arranges a company trip to a ski resort in Hokkaido, that Denchai finally takes a leap of faith by making a wish at the resort’s landmark Lucky ‘N Love Bell. Denchai’s wish is for Nui to be his girl for just ONE DAY.

In an ironic twist of fate, Nui goes skiing alone and passes out in the snow. When she wakes up, she is diagnosed with TGA - a rare but temporary memory loss disorder, which lasts for just one day.

Figuring that this is fate’s way of granting him his wish, Denchai decides to lie to his dream girl by telling her that he is her boyfriend and that they had plans to travel around Hokkaido together. Would you risk everything, no matter how impossible, whatever the outcome, just to be in love for just ONE DAY?
