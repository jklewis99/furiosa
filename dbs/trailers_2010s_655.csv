Jack Malik (Himesh Patel, BBC‚Äôs Eastenders) is a struggling singer-songwriter in a tiny English seaside town whose dreams of fame are rapidly fading, despite the fierce devotion and support of his childhood best friend, Ellie (Lily James, Mamma Mia!

But as his star rises, he risks losing Ellie ‚Äî the one person who always believed in him. With the door between his old life and his new closing, Jack will need to get back to where he once belonged and prove that all you need is love.

Meet the Park Family: the picture of aspirational wealth. And the Kim Family, rich in street smarts but not much else. Be it chance or fate, these two houses are brought together and the Kims sense a golden opportunity. Masterminded by college-aged Ki-woo, the Kim children expediently install themselves as tutor and art therapist, to the Parks. Soon, a symbiotic relationship forms between the two families. The Kims provide ""indispensable"" luxury services while the Parks obliviously bankroll their entire household. When a parasitic interloper threatens the Kims' newfound comfort, a savage, underhanded battle for dominance breaks out, threatening to destroy the fragile ecosystem between the Kims and the Parks.

Para ir a Marte hay que estar muy preparado, tanto f√≠sica como psicol√≥gicamente. Por eso la NASA se encarga de seleccionar con cuidado a los elegidos. Pero, ¬øqu√© pasar√≠a si tomasen una decisi√≥n equivocada, si uno de sus astronautas no estuviese capacitado para soportar un duro viaje a las profundidades del espacio exterior? 
James Gray (El sue√±o de Ellis) dirige esta cinta, que ha co-escrito junto a Ethan Gross (Fringe (Al l√≠mite)). De la producci√≥n se ocupa MadRiver Picture, el estudio encargado de Triple 9 y Orgullo + Prejuicio + Zombis.

Evil resurfaces in Derry as director Andy Muschietti reunites the Losers Club‚Äîyoung and adult‚Äîin a return to where it all began with ‚ÄúIt Chapter Two.‚Äù

The film is Muschietti‚Äôs follow-up to 2017‚Äôs critically acclaimed and massive worldwide box office hit ‚ÄúIT,‚Äù which grossed over $700 million globally.  Both redefining and transcending the genre, ‚ÄúIT‚Äù became part of the cultural zeitgeist as well as the highest-grossing horror film of all time.

Because every 27 years evil revisits the town of Derry, Maine, ‚ÄúIt Chapter Two‚Äù brings the characters‚Äîwho‚Äôve long since gone their separate ways‚Äîback together as adults, nearly three decades after the events of the first film.  

Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain (‚ÄúZero Dark Thirty,‚Äù ‚ÄúMama‚Äù) stars as Beverly, James McAvoy (‚ÄúSplit,‚Äù upcoming ‚ÄúGlass‚Äù) as Bill, Bill Hader (HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúBarry,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Skeleton Twins‚Äù) as Richie, Isaiah Mustafa (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúShadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments‚Äù) as Mike, Jay Ryan (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúMary Kills People‚Äù) as Ben, James Ransone (HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Wire‚Äù) as Eddie, and Andy Bean (‚ÄúAllegiant,‚Äù Starz‚Äô ‚ÄúPower‚Äù) as Stanley.  Reprising their roles as the original members of the Losers Club are Jaeden Martell as Bill, Wyatt Oleff as Stanley, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie, Finn Wolfhard as Richie, Sophia Lillis as Beverly, Chosen Jacobs as Mike, and Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben.  Bill Skarsg√•rd returns in the seminal role of Pennywise.  

Muschietti directed the film from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman (‚ÄúIT,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnnabelle: Creation‚Äù) based on the novel IT by Stephen King.  Barbara Muschietti, Dan Lin and Roy Lee produced the film, with Marty Ewing, Seth Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg serving as the executive producers.

The behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Checco Varese (‚ÄúThe 33‚Äù), Oscar-winning production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (‚ÄúThe Shape of Water‚Äù), editor Jason Ballantine (‚ÄúIT,‚Äù ‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road‚Äù), and Oscar-nominated costume designer Luis Sequeira (‚ÄúThe Shape of Water,‚Äù ‚ÄúMama‚Äù).  The music is by Benjamin Wallfisch (‚ÄúShazam!,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlade Runner 2049,‚Äù ‚ÄúIT‚Äù).

Director Todd Phillips ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù centers around the iconic arch nemesis and is an original, standalone fictional story not seen before on the big screen.  Phillips‚Äô exploration of Arthur Fleck, who is indelibly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, is of a man struggling to find his way in Gotham‚Äôs fractured society.  A clown-for-hire by day, he aspires to be a stand-up comic at night‚Ä¶but finds the joke always seems to be on him.  Caught in a cyclical existence between apathy and cruelty, Arthur makes one bad decision that brings about a chain reaction of escalating events in this gritty character study.
Three-time Oscar nominee Phoenix (‚ÄúThe Master,‚Äù ‚ÄúWalk the Line,‚Äù ‚ÄúGladiator‚Äù) stars in the titular role alongside Oscar winner Robert De Niro (‚ÄúRaging Bull,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Godfather: Part II‚Äù) as Franklin.

Oscar nominee Phillips (‚ÄúBorat,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Hangover‚Äù trilogy) directs from a screenplay he co-wrote with Oscar-nominated writer Scott Silver (‚ÄúThe Fighter‚Äù), based on characters from DC.  The film is produced by Phillips and Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper (‚ÄúA Star Is Born,‚Äù ‚ÄúAmerican Sniper‚Äù) under their Joint Effort banner, and Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff (‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street‚Äù).   It is executive produced by Michael E. Uslan, Walter Hamada, Aaron L. Gilbert, Joseph Garner, Richard Baratta, and Bruce Berman.

2_CRUqp7Ydc,Joker 2 - Revenge - Joaquin Phoenix (2021 Batman Movie Trailer Concept),VJ4rawr2,UCcv9_SD5a2x3T52pjHglPeQ,"Joaquin Phoenix returns as Arthur Fleck in Joker 2: Revenge.  The DC Comics / Batman followup to the 2019 smash film.

Gotham City lays in ruins.  Arthur (as Joker) is captured and sent to Arkham Asylum.  There he meets the brilliant psychologist Vivian Vayle.  But old habits die hard, anarchy rules, and money is the root of all evil.

This is a concept trailer (not to be confused with the TheBatman FanDome Teaser).  That means it's not real.  It's created to give fans an idea of potential future films.  Concept trailers (or fan trailers) are often misunderstood.  By taking existing material, a new stand-alone narrative is created. 

The video was a collaboration with YouTuber Billy Crammer.  Check out his channel for wayyy more awesome videos than I could ever come up with.

My channel (VJ4rawr2) is primarily directed at late 90's films.  I wanted to tie in a Joker sequel to one of my favorite childhood films, Batman 1989.  I took key elements from the original film (the money scene, the gas balloons, Vicky Vale) and updated them in an homage to the original.

If you enjoyed this video then check out some of other content including Titanic 2: Never Let Go, Friends: The Reunion, Forrest Gump 2, Speed 3, Jurassic World 3: Origins, Titanic 2: The Return of Jack, Red Dead Redemption: The Movie and many more.

A decade after Zombieland became a hit film and a cult classic, the lead cast (Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Abigail Breslin, and Emma Stone) have reunited with director Ruben Fleischer (Venom) and the original writers Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick (Deadpool) for Zombieland 2: Double Tap. In the sequel, written by Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick and Dave Callaham, through comic mayhem that stretches from the White House and through the heartland, these four slayers must face off against the many new kinds of zombies that have evolved since the first movie, as well as some new human survivors. But most of all, they have to face the growing pains of their own snarky, makeshift family.
