QlSAiI3xMh4,Snowden | Official Trailer [HD] | Open Road Films,Open Road Films,UClt5Bst8Ji05dZvTUdnO85g,"Academy Award®-winning director Oliver Stone, who brought Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Wall Street and JFK to the big screen, tackles the most important and fascinating true story of the 21st century. Snowden, the politically-charged, pulse-pounding thriller starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Shailene Woodley, reveals the incredible untold personal story of Edward Snowden, the polarizing figure who exposed shocking illegal surveillance activities by the NSA and became one of the most wanted men in the world. He is considered a hero by some, and a traitor by others. No matter which you believe, the epic story of why he did it, who he left behind, and how he pulled it off makes for one of the most compelling films of the year.

Edward Snowden deja su trabajo en una empresa contratista para unirse en 2003 al ejército norteamericano. Pero, tras un aparatoso accidente, se ve obligado a dejarlo. Así acabará trabajando en la NSA y en la CIA, puestos que también abandona. 
Sin embargo, gracias a contar con información privilegiada, Snowden hace una filtración de documentos que relevan importante información sobre la NSA. Tras ser publicado por la prensa de todo el mundo, se produce un revuelo inmediato, pues estos archivos sacaban a la luz una trama de espionaje masivo por parte del Gobierno de Estados Unidos.

Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) arbeitet als Computer-Profi für einen Subunternehmer der NSA. Doch weder seine langjährige Freundin Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley) noch sein Kollege (Keith Stanfield) ahnen, wohin Snowden geht, als er von einem Tag auf den anderen verschwindet.  Snowden trifft sich in Hong Kong mit der Dokumentarfilmerin Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo) sowie dem Journalisten Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto) und dem britischen Korrespondenten Ewen MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson). Er hat sich vorgenommen, mit der Veröffentlichung von streng geheimen Dokumenten das ganze Ausmaß der Überwachung amerikanischer Geheimdienste offenzulegen, auch wenn er seine eigene Person dadurch in Gefahr bringt. Es dauert nicht lange, bis die CIA (Nicolas Cage, Timothy Olyphant) erfährt, wer die Quelle ist, die das geheime Material an die Öffentlichkeit durchsickern lässt.

Privatdetektiv Holland March (Ryan Gosling) und Knochenbrecher Jackson Healy (Russel Crowe) haben nicht wirklich viel gemein. Bis sich beide blöderweise in den Fall der vermissten Amelia verstrickt sehen. Und dann passiert auch noch ein Mord an einem Porno-Star, der scheinbar erst einmal nichts damit zu tun hat. Widerwillig zur Zusammenarbeit gezwungen, streifen sie gemeinsam mit Marchs pubertierenden Tochter Holly (Angourie Rice) durch L. A., um verworrenen Hinweisen auf den Grund zu gehen. Bis Amelias Spur sie auf eine Multi-Milliarden-Dollar-Verschwörung bringt, die sie zum Ziel von skrupellosen Profikillern werden lässt ...

The talents of three of the world’s greatest storytellers – Roald Dahl, Walt Disney and Steven Spielberg –
finally unite to bring Dahl’s beloved classic “The BFG” to life. Directed by Spielberg, Disney’s “The BFG” tells the imaginative story of a young girl and the Giant who introduces her to the wonders and perils of Giant Country. The BFG (Mark Rylance), while a giant himself, is a Big Friendly Giant and nothing like the other inhabitants of Giant Country. Standing 24-feet tall with enormous ears and a keen sense of smell, he is endearingly dim-witted and keeps to himself for the most part. Giants like Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) and Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) on the other hand, are twice as big and at least twice as scary and have been known to eat humans, while the BFG prefers Snozzcumber and Frobscottle. Upon her arrival in Giant Country, Sophie, a precocious 10-year-old girl from London, is initially frightened of the mysterious giant who has brought her to his cave, but soon comes to realize that the BFG is actually quite gentle and charming, and, having never met a giant before, has many questions. The BFG brings Sophie to Dream Country where he collects dreams and sends them to children, teaching her all about the magic and mystery of dreams. Having both been on their own in the world up until now, their affection for one another quickly grows, but Sophie’s presence in Giant Country has attracted the unwanted attention of the other giants, who have become increasingly more bothersome. Sophie and the BFG soon depart for London to see the Queen (Penelope Wilton) and warn her of the precarious giant situation, but they must first convince the Queen and her maid, Mary (Rebecca Hall), that giants do indeed exist. Together, they come up with a plan to get rid of the giants once and for all.

Langt inde i en skov isoleret fra civilisationen bor en hengiven og meget anderledes far med sine seks børn. Ben (Viggo Mortensen) har dedikeret sit liv til ét formål: at sikre at hans børn bliver til nogle ekstraordinære voksne mennesker. Men da en tragedie rammer familien, er de nødt til at forlade det paradis, de selv har skabt, og bevæge sig ind i en ukendt verden. En verden, der udfordrer Bens ide om, hvad det vil sige at være forælder og dermed sætter spørgsmålstegn ved alt det, børnene hidtil har lært.

Der hochgebildete Ben (Viggo Mortensen) lebt aus Überzeugung mit seinen sechs Kindern in der Einsamkeit der Berge im Nordwesten Amerikas. Er unterrichtet sie selbst und bringt ihnen nicht nur ein überdurchschnittliches Wissen bei, sondern auch wie man jagt und in der Wildnis überlebt. Als seine Frau stirbt, ist er gezwungen mitsamt der Sprösslinge seine selbst geschaffene Aussteigeridylle zu verlassen und der realen Welt entgegenzutreten. In ihrem alten, klapprigen Bus macht sich die Familie auf den Weg quer durch die USA zur Beerdigung, die bei den Großeltern stattfinden soll. Ihre Reise ist voller komischer wie berührender Momente, die Bens Freiheitsideale und seine Vorstellungen von Erziehung nachhaltig infrage stellen…

Suit up for classic comedy! Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) take a chance on going freelance, de-haunting houses in a new ghost removal service.

Ghostbusters Official Trailer #2 (2016) - Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy Movie HD

With paranormal activity on the rise, a Columbia University academic, her ghost-chasing friend, the friend's business partner, and an MTA employee join forces to bust ghosts and save New York.

0:47 - Rocker Phil X tweeted that he was going to be in the film. He appears to be a member of the fictional band Beasts of Mayhem.
1:08 - Reference to Jaws. Duh! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I91DJZKRxs
1:17 / 1:29 - A ghost is using Hemsworth for an evil plan. This seems like it's a nod to Gozer from the 
original and how Rick Moranis was possessed.
1:27 - The storm cloud is another reference to the cloud gathering over Dana's building in the original.
1:32 - The building even looks exactly like Dana's apt.
1:49 - Slimer's back! 
2:05 - Our first look at the villain Rowan (who looks to be referencing the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man). He's played by another SNL vet, writer Neil Casey. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aW8oyTgA60

But before the staid numbers-cruncher realizes what he’s getting into, it’s too late to get out, as his increasingly unpredictable new friend drags him through a world of shoot-outs, double-crosses and espionage that could get them both killed in more ways than he can count.

Kinostart: Juni 2016

Wer bei einem Highschool-Treffen alten Klassenkameraden begegnet, kann so manches Mal sein blaues Wunder erleben, was aus den ehemaligen Cheerleadern, Klassenclowns, Sportskanonen und Nerds geworden ist, nachdem ein paar Jahre verstrichen sind. So geht es auch einem ehemaligen Sport-Ass (Kevin Hart), das jetzt als langweiliger Büroangestellter arbeitet. Der Mann wird kurz vor dem geplanten Klassentreffen von einem ehemaligen Loser seines Jahrgangs (Dwayne Johnson) über Facebook kontaktiert wird. Dieser damals so häufig gemobbte Mitschüler ist inzwischen zu einem Berg aus Muskeln geworden und arbeitet für die CIA.

Als CIA-Auftragskiller benötigt er allerdings die Hilfe des ehemaligen Jocks und zieht in deshalb als Spion hinein in eine Welt der Täuschung. Gemeinsam müssen die beiden ein Komplott verhindern, bei dem streng geschützte Militärgeheimnisse auf dem Schwarzmarkt verkauft werden sollen.

Weta digital puts the The Rock’s face onto Vine star Sione’s body for an amazing locker room shower dance scene you won’t want to miss.

OF ALL OF the ""What the...?"" moments in the trailer for the new Kevin Hart/Dwayne Johnson movie Central Intelligence, the moment where a teenaged, less fit version of The Rock's character sings En Vogue in a locker room is the most memorable. It was also, it turns out, pretty hard to make. The process required VFX teams to film Vine star Sione Kelepi (aka Sione Maraschino) and capture his movements, make 3-D facial scans of Kelepi and Johnson, and then combine them into one performance. Find out how they did it in the Design FX video above.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures comes the action adventure “The Legend of Tarzan,” starring Alexander Skarsgård (HBO’s “True Blood”) as the legendary character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. 

The film also stars Oscar nominee Samuel L. Jackson (“Pulp Fiction,” the “Captain America” films), Margot Robbie (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou (“Blood Diamond,” “Gladiator”), Oscar nominee John Hurt (“The Elephant Man,” the “Harry Potter” films), with Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (“Iris”), and two-time Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz (“Inglourious Basterds,” “Django Unchained”).  

It has been years since the man once known as Tarzan (Skarsgård) left the jungles of Africa behind for a gentrified life as John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke, with his beloved wife, Jane (Robbie) at his side.  Now, he has been invited back to the Congo to serve as a trade emissary of Parliament, unaware that he is a pawn in a deadly convergence of greed and revenge, masterminded by the Belgian, Captain Leon Rom (Waltz).  But those behind the murderous plot have no idea what they are about to unleash.

David Yates (the final four “Harry Potter” films, upcoming “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them”) directed “The Legend of Tarzan” from a screenplay by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer, story by Brewer and Cozad based on the Tarzan stories created by Burroughs.  Legendary producer Jerry Weintraub (“Behind the Candelabra,” the “Ocean’s” trilogy) produced the film, together with David Barron (the “Harry Potter” films, “Cinderella”), Alan Riche (“Southpaw”) and Tony Ludwig (“Starsky & Hutch”).  Susan Ekins, Nikolas Korda, Keith Goldberg, David Yates, Mike Richardson and Bruce Berman served as executive producers.

The behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Henry Braham (“The Golden Compass”), Oscar-winning production designer Stuart Craig (“Dangerous Liaisons,” “The English Patient,” the “Harry Potter” films), editor Mark Day (“Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Parts 1 & 2”), and Oscar-nominated costume designer Ruth Myers (“Emma,” “Unknown”).
“The Legend of Tarzan” was shot at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, as well as on location around the UK. 

A Jerry Weintraub production, “The Legend of Tarzan” is slated for release on July 1, 2016.  The film will be distributed in 2D and 3D in select theatres and IMAX by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.",2015-12-10T00:30:06Z,"['the legend of tarzan', 'legend of tarzan', 'tarzan', 'tarzan trailer', 'the legend of tarzan trailer', 'legend of tarzan trailer', 'Alexander Skarsgård', 'Samuel L.

RXMp9fBomJw,The Purge: Election Year - Official Trailer (HD),Universal Pictures,UCq0OueAsdxH6b8nyAspwViw,"The Purge: Election Year 
Official Trailer 
http://www.thepurgeelectionyear.com

Expanding the universe introduced in the hit franchise that electrified the culture and earned $200 million at the worldwide box office, Universal Pictures’ The Purge: Election Year reveals the next terrifying chapter that occurs over 12 hours of annual lawlessness sanctioned by the New Founders of America to keep this country great.
 
It’s been two years since Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) stopped himself from a regrettable act of revenge on Purge Night.  Now serving as head of security for Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell), his mission is to protect her in a run for president and survive the annual ritual that targets the poor and innocent.  But when a betrayal forces them onto the streets of D.C. on the one night when no help is available, they must stay alive until dawn…or both be sacrificed for their sins against the state.
 
Once again returning to collaborate with franchise creator James DeMonaco on The Purge: Election Year are the series’ producers: Blumhouse Productions’ Jason Blum (Insidious and Ouija series, The Visit), Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ouija series, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and writer/director DeMonaco’s longtime production partner, Sébastien K.

https://www.facebook.com/lightsoutthemovie

From producer James Wan (“The Conjuring”) comes a tale of an unknown terror that lurks in the dark.  

When Rebecca left home, she thought she left her childhood fears behind.  Growing up, she was never really sure of what was and wasn’t real when the lights went out…and now her little brother, Martin, is experiencing the same unexplained and terrifying events that had once tested her sanity and threatened her safety.  A frightening entity with a mysterious attachment to their mother, Sophie, has reemerged.  

But this time, as Rebecca gets closer to unlocking the truth, there is no denying that all their lives are in danger…once the lights go out.

The film stars Teresa Palmer (“Triple 9”) as Rebecca; Gabriel Bateman (“Annabelle”) as Martin; Billy Burke (the “Twilight” franchise) as Martin’s father, Paul; Alexander DiPersia (“Forever”) as Rebecca’s boyfriend, Bret; and Maria Bello (“Prisoners”) as Sophie.  

“Lights Out” marks the feature film directorial debut of David F. Sandberg, who directed the film from a screenplay by Eric Heisserer (“Final Destination 5”), based on Sandberg’s own short film.  James Wan, Lawrence Grey and Heisserer produced the film, with Walter Hamada, Dave Neustadter and Richard Brener serving as executive producers.

Sandberg’s behind-the-scenes team included director of photography Marc Spicer (“Furious 7”), production designer Jennifer Spence (the “Insidious” films), editor Kirk Morri (“The Conjuring”) and costume designer Kristin M. Burke (“The Conjuring”).  The music is composed by Benjamin Wallfisch.

From Oscar-winning director Clint Eastwood (“American Sniper,” “Million Dollar Baby”) comes Warner Bros. Pictures’ drama “Sully,” starring Oscar winner Tom Hanks (“Bridge of Spies,” “Forrest Gump”) as Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger.

On January 15, 2009, the world witnessed the “Miracle on the Hudson” when Captain “Sully” Sullenberger glided his disabled plane onto the frigid waters of the Hudson River, saving the lives of all 155 aboard.  However, even as Sully was being heralded by the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill, an investigation was unfolding that threatened to destroy his reputation and his career.

“Sully” also stars Aaron Eckhart (“Olympus Has Fallen,” “The Dark Knight”) as Sully’s co-pilot, Jeff Skiles, and Oscar nominee Laura Linney (“The Savages,” “Kinsey,” Showtime’s “The Big C”) as Sully’s wife, Lorraine Sullenberger.  

Eastwood is directing the film from a screenplay by Todd Komarnicki, based on the book Highest Duty by Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow.  The project is being produced by Eastwood, Frank Marshall, Allyn Stewart and Tim Moore, with Kipp Nelson and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.

The film reunites Eastwood with several of his longtime collaborators, who most recently worked with the director on the worldwide hit “American Sniper”: director of photography Tom Stern and production designer James J. Murakami, who were both Oscar-nominated for their work on “The Changeling”; costume designer Deborah Hopper; and editor Blu Murray.

Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Flashlight Films production, a Kennedy/Marshall Company production, a Malpaso production, “Sully.”  The film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

Am 15. Januar 2009 erlebte die Welt das „Wunder auf dem Hudson“, als Captain „Sully“ Sullenberger sein defektes Flugzeug im Gleitflug auf dem eisigen Wasser des Hudson Rivers notlandete und das Leben aller 155 Menschen an Bord rettete. Doch während Sully noch von der Öffentlichkeit und in den Medien für seine beispiellose flugtechnische Meisterleistung gefeiert wurde, begann man bereits mit der Untersuchung des Falls, der fast seinen Ruf und seine Laufbahn ruiniert hätte.""

From director Todd Phillips (“The Hangover” trilogy) comes “War Dogs,” starring Oscar nominee Jonah Hill (“The Wolf of Wall Street,” “Moneyball”) and Miles Teller (“Whiplash,” the “Divergent” trilogy).

Based on a true story, “War Dogs” follows two friends in their early 20s (Hill and Teller) living in Miami Beach during the Iraq War who exploit a little-known government initiative that allows small businesses to bid on U.S. Military contracts.  Starting small, they begin raking in big money and are living the high life.  But the pair gets in over their heads when they land a 300 million dollar deal to arm the Afghan Military—a deal that puts them in business with some very shady people, not the least of which turns out to be the U.S. Government.  

The film also stars Ana de Armas (“Knock Knock”) and Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper (“American Sniper,” “American Hustle”).
The screenplay is by Stephen Chin and Todd Phillips & Jason Smilovic, based on the Rolling Stone article titled “Arms and the Dudes,” by Guy Lawson.  Mark Gordon (“Steve Jobs”), Todd Phillips and Bradley Cooper are the producers, with David Siegel and Bryan Zuriff serving as executive producers.

“War Dogs” reunites Phillips with several of his collaborators from “The Hangover” trilogy, including director of photography Lawrence Sher, production designer Bill Brzeski and editor Jeff Groth.  Joining the team is costume designer Michael Kaplan (“Star Trek,” “Star Trek: Into Darkness”).  The music is by Cliff Martinez (“Drive,” “Traffic”).

Warner Bros. Pictures presents a Joint Effort/Mark Gordon Company Production, a Todd Phillips movie, “War Dogs.”  Slated for release on August 19, 2016, the film will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

In der auf wahren Begebenheiten beruhenden Krimi-Komödie War Dogs handeln sich die Kiffer Miles Teller und Jonah Hill nicht nur einen Waffendeal mit der US-Regierung ein, sondern auch jede Menge Ärger in Afghanistan.

Handlung von War Dogs
War Dogs dreht sich um zwei Freunde aus Miami Beach. Während der Irak-Krieg in Übersee ausgetragen wird, führen die beiden Marihuana-Liebhaber ein ganz entspanntes Leben in Florida: Der eine (Miles Teller) ist ein zertifizierter Massage-Therapeut, der andere (Jonah Hill) hingegen ein Waffenhändler mit nicht allzu großer Reichweite.

In einer wenig bekannten Initiative der US-Regierung, die kleine Firmen für Waffenlieferungen verpflichtet, wollen auch die beiden Kiffer ein paar Moneten abgreifen. Statt des kleinen Deals ziehen sie allerdings einen 300-Millionen-Dollar-Auftrag an Land, der sie mit einem Schlag zu internationalen Waffenhändlern macht. Nun sollen sie plötzlich die Truppen und Verbündeten der USA in Afghanistan mit Munition und mehr versorgen, und obwohl sie schlichtweg überfordert sind, versuchen sie, ihr Bestes zu geben, um an das Geld zu kommen.

Bald können allerdings weder Davids Freundin Iz (Ana de Armas) noch seine rechte Hand Bashkim (JB Blanc) ihm noch aus der Patsche helfen, in die er sich manövriert hat, zumal die zwielichtigen Handelspartner der Freunde nicht mehr viel mit der US-Regierung zu tun zu haben scheinen …

„War Dogs“ beruht auf einer wahren Geschichte: Zwei Freunde Anfang 20 (Hill und Teller) leben während des ersten Irak-Kriegs in Miami und nutzen eine wenig bekannte staatliche Regelung aus, nach der sich auch kleine Firmen um amerikanische Rüstungsaufträge bewerben dürfen. Nach bescheidenen Anfängen sprudelt plötzlich das Geld und erlaubt den beiden ein Leben in Saus und Braus. Doch dann verheben sie sich kräftig: Sie sichern sich einen 300 Millionen schweren Auftrag und sollen der afghanischen Armee Waffen liefern – bei diesem Deal bekommen es die beiden mit äußerst zwielichtigen Partnern zu tun – und wie sich herausstellt, gehört dazu auch die amerikanische Regierung.

Everyone knows that growing up is hard, and life is no easier for high school junior Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld), who is already at peak awkwardness when her all-star older brother Darian (Blake Jenner) starts dating her best friend Krista (Haley Lu Richardson)
 
All at once, Nadine feels more alone than ever, until the unexpected friendship of a thoughtful boy (Hayden Szeto) gives her a glimmer of hope that things just might not be so terrible after all.
 
The film also stars Kyra Sedgwick as Nadine’s well-meaning but completely ineffective mother, and Woody Harrelson as Nadine’s History teacher, mentor and reluctant sounding board. 
 
The Edge of Seventeen marks the feature directorial debut of writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig, and is produced by Academy Award® winner James L. Brooks – the filmmaker behind big-screen, character-driven classics such as Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News, Big, Say Anything, The Simpsons, Jerry Maguire and As Good as It Gets.

Kubo and the Two Strings Official Trailer #1 (2015) - Rooney Mara Animated Movie HD

Kubo and the Two Strings is an epic action-adventure set in a fantastical Japan from acclaimed animation studio LAIKA.  Clever, kindhearted Kubo (voiced by Art Parkinson of Game of Thrones) ekes out a humble living, telling stories to the people of his seaside town including Hosato (George Takei), Hashi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and Kamekichi (Academy Award nominee Brenda Vaccaro).  But his relatively quiet existence is shattered when he accidentally summons a spirit from his past which storms down from the heavens to enforce an age-old vendetta. Now on the run, Kubo joins forces with Monkey (Academy Award winner Charlize Theron) and Beetle (Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey), and sets out on a thrilling quest to save his family and solve the mystery of his fallen father, the greatest samurai warrior the world has ever known.  With the help of his shamisen - a magical musical instrument - Kubo must battle gods and monsters, including the vengeful Moon King (Academy Award nominee Ralph Fiennes) and the evil twin Sisters (Academy Award nominee Rooney Mara)  to unlock the secret of his legacy, reunite his family and fulfill his heroic destiny.

https://www.bridgetjonesmovie.com

Oscar® winners Renée Zellweger and Colin Firth are joined by Patrick Dempsey for the next chapter of the world’s favorite singleton in Bridget Jones’s Baby.  Directed by Sharon Maguire (Bridget Jones’s Diary), the new film in the beloved comedy series based on creator Helen Fielding’s heroine finds Bridget unexpectedly expecting. 

After breaking up with Mark Darcy (Firth), Bridget Jones’s (Zellweger) “happily ever after” hasn’t quite gone according to plan.  Fortysomething and single again, she decides to focus on her job as top news producer and surround herself with old friends and new.  For once, Bridget has everything completely under control.  What could possibly go wrong?

Then her love life takes a turn and Bridget meets a dashing American named Jack (Dempsey), the suitor who is everything Mr. Darcy is not.  In an unlikely twist she finds herself pregnant, but with one hitch…she can only be fifty percent sure of the identity of her baby’s father.

The much-anticipated third installment of the Bridget Jones’s franchise welcomes fellow Academy Award® winner Emma Thompson to the cast.  Longtime collaborators Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner of Working Title Films produce alongside Debra Hayward.  Universal Pictures will distribute Bridget Jones’s Baby in North America and select international territories.

The house she lived in with her husband, who still lives there, with his new wife and child. As she attempts to not focus on her pain, she starts watching a couple a few houses down -- Megan and Scott Hipwell. She creates a wonderful dream life for them in her head, about how they are a perfect happy family. And then one day, as the train passes, she sees something shocking, filling her with rage. The next day, she wakes up with a horrible hangover, various wounds and bruises, and no memory of the night before. She has only a feeling: something bad happened. Then come the TV reports: Megan Hipwell is missing. Rachel becomes invested in the case and trying to find out what happened to Megan, where she is, and what exactly she herself was up to that same night Megan went missing.

Inhalt: Rachel (Emily Blunt) ist nach ihrer Scheidung am Boden zerstört. Ihren täglichen Weg zur Arbeit verbringt sie damit, über das vermeintlich perfekte Paar zu phantasieren. Jeden Morgen passiert ihr Zug eine Reihe von Einfamilienhäusern, immer wieder beobachtet Rachel die Menschen in ihrem Zuhause und jedes Mal flüchtet sie sich dabei in eine Traumwelt. Besonders ein Paar hat es Rachel angetan, in ihrer Vorstellung führen die beiden ein perfektes Leben. Doch eines Morgens beobachtet Rachel etwas Schockierendes. Als sie kurz darauf aus der Zeitung erfährt, dass genau die Frau, die sie tagtäglich beobachtet, verschwunden ist, wendet sie sich an die Polizei. Unaufhaltsam wird Rachel immer tiefer in ein Labyrinth aus Lügen, Träumen, Wunschvorstellungen und realer Gefahr verwoben und schon bald droht die Heldin dem Wahnsinn zu verfallen…

____________________
From director Makoto Shinkai, the innovative mind behind Voices of a Distant Star and 5 Centimeters Per Second, comes a beautiful masterpiece about time, the thread of fate, and the hearts of two young souls.

The day the stars fell, two lives changed forever. High schoolers Mitsuha and Taki are complete strangers living separate lives. But one night, they suddenly switch places. Mitsuha wakes up in Taki’s body, and he in hers. This bizarre occurrence continues to happen randomly, and the two must adjust their lives around each other. Yet, somehow, it works. They build a connection and communicate by leaving notes, messages, and more importantly, an imprint.

When a dazzling comet lights up the night’s sky, something shifts, and they seek each other out wanting something more—a chance to finally meet. But try as they might, something more daunting than distance prevents them. Is the string of fate between Mitsuha and Taki strong enough to bring them together, or will forces outside their control leave them forever separated?",2017-03-10T17:37:07Z,"['Shinkai', 'Kimi no nawa', 'Makoto Shinkai', 'funimation films', 'anime', 'movie', 'funimation', 'english', 'dubbed', 'dub']",1148067,19048,314,2541,372058,0.489873417721519

____________________
From director Makoto Shinkai, the innovative mind behind Voices of a Distant Star and 5 Centimeters Per Second, comes a beautiful masterpiece about time, the thread of fate, and the hearts of two young souls.

The day the stars fell, two lives changed forever. High schoolers Mitsuha and Taki are complete strangers living separate lives. But one night, they suddenly switch places. Mitsuha wakes up in Taki’s body, and he in hers. This bizarre occurrence continues to happen randomly, and the two must adjust their lives around each other. Yet, somehow, it works. They build a connection and communicate by leaving notes, messages, and more importantly, an imprint.

When a dazzling comet lights up the night’s sky, something shifts, and they seek each other out wanting something more—a chance to finally meet. But try as they might, something more daunting than distance prevents them. Is the string of fate between Mitsuha and Taki strong enough to bring them together, or will forces outside their control leave them forever separated?",2017-03-10T17:38:07Z,"['shinkai', 'your name', 'kimi no nawa', 'anime', 'movie', 'funimation', 'award winning']",75515,1805,23,166,372058,0.489873417721519

HACKSAW RIDGE is the extraordinary true story of Desmond Doss [Andrew Garfield] who, in Okinawa during the bloodiest battle of WWII, saved 75 men without firing or carrying a gun. He was the only American soldier in WWII to fight on the front lines without a weapon, as he believed that while the war was justified, killing was nevertheless wrong. As an army medic, he single-handedly evacuated the wounded from behind enemy lines, braved fire while tending to soldiers and was wounded by a grenade and hit by snipers. Doss was the first conscientious objector awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.",2016-07-28T12:59:49Z,"['Hacksaw Ridge', '2016', 'movie', 'film', 'lionsgate', 'Andrew Garfield', 'Sam Worthington', 'Luke Bracey', 'Teresa Palmer', 'Hugo Weaving', 'Rachel Griffiths', 'Vince Vaughn', 'true story', 'Desmond Doss', 'Okinawa', 'WWII', 'World War II', 'war', 'war movie', 'battle', 'American soldier', 'soldier', 'weapon', 'gun', 'killing', 'army', 'medic', 'behind enemy lines', 'brave', 'Congressional Medal of Honor', 'hero', 'army hero', 'official trailer', 'trailer', 'believe', 'faith']",22997928,125921,3733,12789,324786,0.4006024096385542

Directed by Francesco Bertolini, Adolfo Padovan and Giuseppe de Liguoro it was the first Italian feature film and features some striking images, spectacular for their time.

I have written a new soundtrack to the film inspired by the entrancing beauty of Gregorian Chant, music which resonates both with the images and the story. I have taken this music, and written some original material, to create a soundtrack which I believe remains true to the spirit of the poem and the film. The chants I am working with were written at, or before, the time of Dante, it is the music he would have known.

The planned screenings of the film will be accompanied with a live laptop performance of the soundtrack.

From the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation’s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  

After the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps – trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  

Utilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the ‘60s through the ‘80s.

In an adventure that will take them well beyond what they’ve known before, Poppy (Kendrick) and Branch (Timberlake) discover that they are but one of six different Troll tribes scattered over six different lands and devoted to six different kinds of music: Funk, Country, Techno, Classical, Pop and Rock. Their world is about to get a lot bigger and a whole lot louder.

A member of hard-rock royalty, Queen Barb (Rachel Bloom), aided by her father King Thrash (Ozzy Osbourne), wants to destroy all other kinds of music to let rock reign supreme. With the fate of the world at stake, Poppy and Branch, along with their friends — Biggie (James Corden), Chenille (Caroline Hjelt), Satin (Aino Jawo), Cooper (Ron Funches) and Guy Diamond (Kunal Nayyar) — set out to visit all the other lands to unify the Trolls in harmony against Barb, who’s looking to upstage them all.

Cast as members of the different musical tribes is one the largest, and most acclaimed, groups of musical talent ever assembled for an animated film. From the land of Funk are Mary J. Blige, George Clinton and Anderson .Paak. Representing Country is Kelly Clarkson as Delta Dawn, with Sam Rockwell as Hickory and Flula Borg as Dickory. J Balvin brings Reggaeton, while Ester Dean adds to the Pop tribe. Anthony Ramos brings the beat in Techno and Jamie Dornan covers smooth jazz. World-renowned conductor and violinist Gustavo Dudamel appears as Trollzart and Charlyne Yi as Pennywhistle from the land of Classical. And Kenan Thompson raps as a hip-hop newborn Troll named Tiny Diamond.

Trolls World Tour is directed by Walt Dohrn, who served as co-director on Trolls, and is produced by returning producer Gina Shay. The film is co-directed by David P. Smith and co-produced by Kelly Cooney Cilella, both of whom worked on the first Trolls. Trolls World Tour will also feature original music by Justin Timberlake, who earned an Oscar® nomination for his song for 2016’s Trolls, “Can’t Stop the Feeling!,” and a score by Theodore Shapiro (2016’s Ghostbusters, The Devil Wears Prada).

From the creators of SHREK comes DreamWorks Animation’s TROLLS, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it.  This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomachs.  

After the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends.  Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a rescue mission full of adventure and mishaps – trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done.  

Utilizing music to further the film's narrative, the TROLLS soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features five original songs including songs by Justin Timberlake, Ariana Grande, Anna Kendrick and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the ‘60s through the ‘80s.

Ein Tag wie jeder andere im Leben des fünfjährigen Saroo: Auf dem Bahnhof der indischen Kleinstadt, in der sein Bruder ihn für einige Stunden zurückgelassen hat, sucht er nach Münzen und Essensresten. Vor Erschöpfung schläft er schließlich in einem haltenden Zug ein und findet sich nach einer traumatischen Zugfahrt am anderen Ende des Kontinents in Kalkutta wieder. Auf sich allein gestellt irrt er wochenlang durch die gefährlichen Straßen der Stadt, bis er in einem Waisenhaus landet, wo er von Sue (Nicole Kidman) und John Brierley (David Wenham) adoptiert wird, die ihm ein liebevolles Zuhause in Australien schenken. Viele Jahre später lebt Saroo in Melbourne, ist beruflich erfolgreich und wohnt mit seiner Freundin Lucy (Rooney Mara) zusammen. Er könnte rundum glücklich sein, doch die Frage nach seiner Herkunft lässt ihn nicht los. Nacht für Nacht fährt er mit Google Earth auf seinem Laptop das Zugnetz Indiens ab, zoomt auf hunderte von Bahnhöfen und sucht nach Hinweisen auf seinen früheren Wohnort und seine leibliche Familie. Er hat die Hoffnung schon fast aufgegeben, als das Unglaubliche passiert und er im Internet auf ein Dorf stößt, das seiner Erinnerung entspricht.

It's just another night at the morgue for a father (Brian Cox, Trick 'r Treat, Zodiac ) and son (Emile Hirsch, Lone Survivor, Killer Joe ) team of coroners, until an unidentified, highly unusual corpse arrives. Discovered buried in the basement of the home of a brutally murdered family, the young Jane Doe — eerily well-preserved and with no visible signs of trauma — is shrouded in mystery. As they work into the night to piece together the cause of her death, the two men begin to uncover the disturbing secrets of her life. Soon, a series of terrifying events make it clear: this Jane Doe may not be dead. The latest from Troll Hunter director André Øvredal is a scarily unpredictable, supernatural shocker that never lets up. This chiller also stars Ophelia Lovibond (Guardians Of The Galaxy ) and Michael McElhatton (Game Of Thrones ).

Three thousand years ago, the greatest sailors in the world voyaged across the vast Pacific, discovering the many islands of Oceania. But then, for a millennium, their voyages stopped – and no one knows why.
 
From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes “Moana,” a sweeping, CG-animated feature film about an adventurous teenager who sails out on a daring mission to save her people. During her journey, Moana (voice of Auli’i Cravalho) meets the once-mighty demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson), who guides her in her quest to become a master wayfinder.

While the mental divisions of those with dissociative identity disorder have long fascinated and eluded science, it is believed that some can also manifest unique physical attributes for each personality, a cognitive and physiological prism within a single being.

Though Kevin (James McAvoy) has evidenced 23 personalities to his trusted psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley), there remains one still submerged who is set to materialize and dominate all the others. Compelled to abduct three teenage girls led by the willful, observant Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, The Witch), Kevin reaches a war for survival among all of those contained within him—as well as everyone around him—as the walls between his compartments shatter apart.

M. Night Shyamalan brings together the narratives of two of his standout originals—2000’s Unbreakable, from Touchstone, and 2016’s Split, from Universal—in one explosive, all-new comic-book thriller: Glass.  

From Unbreakable, Bruce Willis returns as David Dunn as does Samuel L. Jackson as Elijah Price, known also by his pseudonym Mr. Glass.  Joining from Split are James McAvoy, reprising his role as Kevin Wendell Crumb and the multiple identities who reside within, and Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke, the only captive to survive an encounter with The Beast.  
 
Following the conclusion of Split, Glass finds Dunn pursuing Crumb’s superhuman figure of The Beast in a series of escalating encounters, while the shadowy presence of Price emerges as an orchestrator who holds secrets critical to both men.

Joining the all-star cast are Unbreakable’s Spencer Treat Clark and Charlayne Woodard, who reprise their roles as Dunn’s son and Price’s mother, as well as Golden Globe Award winner Sarah Paulson (American Horror Story series).
 
This riveting culmination of his worldwide blockbusters is produced by Shyamalan and Blumhouse Production’s Jason Blum, who also produced the writer/director’s previous two films for Universal.  They produce again with Ashwin Rajan and Marc Bienstock, and Steven Schneider and Kevin Frakes, who executive produce.  Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum also serve as executive producers.

A Blinding Edge Pictures and Blumhouse production, Glass will be released by Universal Pictures in North America on January 18, 2019, and by Buena Vista International abroad.

Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe)—brilliant African-American women working at NASA, who served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, a stunning achievement that restored the nation’s confidence, turned around the Space Race, and galvanized the world.  The visionary trio crossed all gender and race lines to inspire generations to dream big.

McDonald’s verdankt seine stetig wachsende Beliebtheit und Verbreitung nicht der gleichnamigen Familie sondern dem Verkäufer M Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) aus Illinois. 
Er lernt in den 50er Jahren die Brüder Mac McDonald (John Carroll Lynch) und Dick McDonald (Nick Offerman) kennen und hilft ihnen mit ihrem Geschäft zu expandieren.
Die Umsätze gehen bald durch die Decke und die Geschwister Mc Donald nicht ganz freiwillig aus dem Unternehmen.

Over the holidays, Ned (Bryan Cranston), an overprotective but loving dad and his family visit his daughter at Stanford, where he meets his biggest nightmare: her well-meaning but socially awkward Silicon Valley billionaire boyfriend, Laird (James Franco). The straight-laced Ned thinks Laird, who has absolutely no filter, is a wildly inappropriate match for his daughter. The one-sided rivalry—and Ned’s panic level—escalate when he finds himself increasingly out of step in the glamorous high-tech hub, and learns that Laird is about to pop the question.

Directed by John Hamburg

Why Him? Official Trailer 1 (2016) - Bryan Cranston Movie

Over the holidays, Ned (Bryan Cranston), an overprotective but loving dad and his family visit his daughter at Stanford, where he meets his biggest nightmare: her well-meaning but socially awkward Silicon Valley billionaire boyfriend, Laird (James Franco). The straight-laced Ned thinks Laird, who has absolutely no filter, is a wildly inappropriate match for his daughter. The one-sided rivalry-and Ned's panic level-escalate when he finds himself increasingly out of step in the glamorous high-tech hub, and learns that Laird is about to pop the question.

Following the release of The Secret Life of Pets in summer 2016, Illumination presents Sing at the holidays. Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Scarlett Johansson, John C. Reilly, Taron Egerton and Tori Kelly star in a musical comedy about finding the shining star that lives inside all of us.
Set in a world like ours but entirely inhabited by animals, Sing stars Buster Moon (Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey), a dapper Koala who presides over a once-grand theater that has fallen on hard times. Buster is an eternal optimist—okay, maybe a bit of a scoundrel—who loves his theater above all and will do anything to preserve it. Now facing the crumbling of his life’s ambition, he has one final chance to restore his fading jewel to its former glory by producing the world’s greatest singing competition.
Five lead contestants emerge: A mouse (Seth MacFarlane) who croons as smoothly as he cons, a timid teenage elephant (Tori Kelly) with an enormous case of stage fright, an overtaxed mother (Academy Award® winner Reese Witherspoon) run ragged tending a litter of 25 piglets, a young gangster gorilla (Taron Egerton) looking to break free of his family’s felonies, and a punk-rock porcupine (Scarlett Johansson) struggling to shed her arrogant boyfriend and go solo. Each animal arrives under Buster’s marquee believing that this is their shot to change the course of their life.
Featuring more than 85 hit songs, Sing is written and directed by Garth Jennings (Son of Rambow, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) and produced by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy. Released by Universal Pictures, Sing arrives in theaters for the holiday season on December 21, 2016. http://www.singmovie.com",2016-08-05T16:58:30Z,"['film', 'movie', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'moviemaniacs', 'offical trailer']",15536174,13671,1236,749,335797,0.22416666666666668

Some friendships transcend lifetimes. In A Dog’s Journey, the sequel to the heartwarming global hit A Dog’s Purpose, beloved dog Bailey finds his new destiny and forms an unbreakable bond that will lead him, and the people he loves, to places they never imagined. 

Bailey (voiced again by Josh Gad) is living the good life on the Michigan farm of his “boy,” Ethan (Dennis Quaid) and Ethan’s wife Hannah (Marg Helgenberger). He even has a new playmate: Ethan and Hannah’s baby granddaughter, CJ. The problem is that CJ’s mom, Gloria (Betty Gilpin), decides to take CJ away. As Bailey’s soul prepares to leave this life for a new one, he makes a promise to Ethan to find CJ and protect her at any cost. 

Thus begins Bailey’s adventure through multiple lives filled with love, friendship and devotion as he, CJ (Kathryn Prescott), and CJ’s best friend Trent (Henry Lau) experience joy and heartbreak, music and laughter, and few really good belly rubs. 

Directed by Emmy winner Gail Mancuso (TV’s Modern Family), A Dog’s Journey is produced by Gavin Polone (A Dog’s Purpose), and written by W. Bruce Cameron & Cathryn Michon, and Maya Forbes & Wally Wolodarsky, based on the best-selling novel by Cameron. The film, from Amblin Entertainment and Reliance Entertainment, in association with Walden Media and Alibaba Pictures, will be distributed by Universal Pictures domestically, and by Universal Pictures and Amblin Partners internationally.",2019-01-29T16:00:11Z,"['a dogs purpose', 'a dogs journey', 'a dogs journey movie', 'dogs', 'dog movies', 'w. bruce cameron', 'bailey', 'dennis quaid', 'josh gad', 'marg helgenberger', 'betty gilpin', 'henry lau', 'kathryn prescott', 'gail mancuso', 'gavin polone', 'amblin entertainment', 'walden media', 'universal pictures', 'movie trailers', 'i love dogs', 'book movies']",19438662,102542,2350,7840,381289,0.33298701298701294

This was started in early November... only just now finished it bc I had gotten almost 2 minutes into it but got really stuck with the fourth dog. I had originally wanted to make the fourth dog Duke, but he didn't fit too well and his body proportions were driving me crazy when they were put up next to all the other dogs in this so I scrapped the idea of using him and couldn't for the life of me think of a replacement.
I don't know if I did the original trailer any justice, but I'm glad I finally finished this nonetheless! If you guys haven't seen this movie, you really should. It's phenomenal and totally worth it ;u;

The third explosive chapter of the blockbuster franchise that redefined the spy thriller finds extreme athlete turned government operative Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) coming out of self-imposed exile and on a collision course with deadly alpha warrior Xiang and his team in a race to recover a sinister and seemingly unstoppable weapon known as Pandora’s Box. Recruiting an all-new group of thrill-seeking cohorts, Xander finds himself enmeshed in a deadly conspiracy that points to collusion at the highest levels of world governments. Packed with the series’ signature deadpan wit and bad-ass attitude, “xXx:RETURN OF XANDER CAGE” will raise the bar on extreme action with some of the most mind-blowing stunts to ever be caught on film.

Director: D. J. Caruso
Starring: Vin Diesel, Deepika Padukone, Donnie Yen, Tony Jaa, Nina Dobrev, Rory McCann and Samuel L. Jackson.

What you can’t see can hurt you. Emmy winner Elisabeth Moss (Us, Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale) stars in a terrifying modern tale of obsession inspired by Universal’s classic monster character. 

Trapped in a violent, controlling relationship with a wealthy and brilliant scientist, Cecilia Kass (Moss) escapes in the dead of night and disappears into hiding, aided by her sister (Harriet Dyer, NBC’s The InBetween), their childhood friend (Aldis Hodge, Straight Outta Compton) and his teenage daughter (Storm Reid, HBO’s Euphoria). 

But when Cecilia’s abusive ex (Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Netflix’s The Haunting of Hill House) commits suicide and leaves her a generous portion of his vast fortune, Cecilia suspects his death was a hoax. As a series of eerie coincidences turns lethal, threatening the lives of those she loves, Cecilia’s sanity begins to unravel as she desperately tries to prove that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see. 

Jason Blum, our current-day master of the horror genre, produces The Invisible Man for his Blumhouse Productions. The Invisible Man is written, directed and executive produced by Leigh Whannell, one of the original conceivers of the Saw franchise who most recently directed Upgrade and Insidious: Chapter 3. 

The film is also produced by Kylie du Fresne (Upgrade, The Sapphires) for Goalpost Pictures. The executive producers are Whannell, Beatriz Sequeira, Charles Layton, Rosemary Blight, Ben Grant, Couper Samuelson and Jeanette Volturno. The Invisible Man is a co-production of Goalpost Pictures Australia and Blumhouse Productions, in association with Nervous Tick, for Universal Pictures.",2020-02-07T17:00:07Z,[],10120654,42734,3287,6327,411088,0.3435920992191088

After sending shockwaves across contemporary culture and setting a new standard for provocative, socially-conscious horror films with his directorial debut, Get Out, Academy Award®-winning visionary Jordan Peele returns with another original nightmare that he has written, directed and produced.

Set in present day along the iconic Northern California coastline, Us, from Monkeypaw Productions, stars Oscar® winner Lupita Nyong’o as Adelaide Wilson, a woman returning to her beachside childhood home with her husband, Gabe (Black Panther’s Winston Duke), and their two children (Shahadi Wright Joseph, Evan Alex) for an idyllic summer getaway. 

Haunted by an unexplainable and unresolved trauma from her past and compounded by a string of eerie coincidences, Adelaide feels her paranoia elevate to high-alert as she grows increasingly certain that something bad is going to befall her family.

After spending a tense beach day with their friends, the Tylers (Emmy winner Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker, Cali Sheldon, Noelle Sheldon), Adelaide and her family return to their vacation home. When darkness falls, the Wilsons discover the silhouette of four figures holding hands as they stand in the driveway. Us pits an endearing American family against a terrifying and uncanny opponent: doppelgängers of themselves. 

Writer and director Peele produces for his Monkeypaw Productions alongside Sean McKittrick, Jason Blum, and Monkeypaw’s Ian Cooper. Us will be released by Universal Pictures on Friday, March 22, 2019.",2018-12-25T14:00:08Z,[],30501636,292504,12508,33036,419430,0.2375886524822695

Chris (Daniel Kaluuya, Sicario) ontmoet eindelijk de ouders van zijn vriendin, Rose (Allison Williams, Girls), en spenderen een weekend op het platteland met Missy (Catherine Keener, Captain Phillips) en Dean (Bradley Whitford, The Cabin in the Woods).
Eerst denkt Chris dat het overdreven vriendelijk gedrag van de familie een nerveuze pogingen is om om te gaan met de interraciale relatie van hun dochter, maar als het weekend vordert, leiden een reeks verontrustende ontdekkingen hem naar een waarheid die hij zich nooit had kunnen voorstellen.

Get Out de Universal Pictures est un thriller spéculatif de Blumhouse (producteurs de The Visit, la série Insidious et The Gift) et  Jordan Peele.
Couple mixte, Chris et sa petite amie Rose filent le parfait amour. Lorsque le jeune Afro-Américain visite le domaine de sa petite amie blanche, il devient prisonnier de la véritable raison de cette sinistre invitation.

Maintenant que Chris (Daniel Kaluuya, Sicario) et sa petite amie, Rose (Allison Williams, Girls), ont atteint l'étape de la rencontre avec les parents, elle l'invite pour une escapade lors d’un  week-end avec Missy (Catherine Keener, Captain Phillips) et Dean (Bradley Whitford, La cabane dans les bois).
Au début, Chris interprète le comportement excessivement gentil de sa belle-famille comme des tentatives nerveuses de traiter la relation interraciale de leur fille, mais très vite une série de découvertes de plus en plus troublantes le mènent à une vérité qu'il n'aurait jamais pu imaginer.

What if you had only one day to change absolutely everything? Samantha Kingston has everything: the perfect friends, the perfect guy, and a seemingly perfect future. Then, everything changes. After one fateful night, Sam wakes up with no future at all. Trapped reliving the same day over and over, she begins to question just how perfect her life really was. As she begins to untangle the mystery of a life suddenly derailed, she must also unwind the secrets of the people closest to her, and discover the power of a single day to make a difference, not just in her own life, but in the lives of those around her—before she runs out of time for good.

jIM4-HLtUM0,King Arthur: Legend of the Sword - Official Trailer [HD],Warner Bros. Pictures,UCjmJDM5pRKbUlVIzDYYWb6g,"Charlie Hunnam stars in KING ARTHUR: LEGEND OF THE SWORD, directed by Guy Ritchie - in theaters May 12, 2017.
---
Acclaimed filmmaker Guy Ritchie brings his dynamic style to the epic fantasy action adventure “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.” Starring Charlie Hunnam in the title role, the film is an iconoclastic take on the classic Excalibur myth, tracing Arthur’s journey from the streets to the throne.

When the child Arthur’s father is murdered, Vortigern (Jude Law), Arthur’s uncle, seizes the crown. Robbed of his birthright and with no idea who he truly is, Arthur comes up the hard way in the back alleys of the city. But once he pulls the sword from the stone, his life is turned upside down and he is forced to acknowledge his true legacy…whether he likes it or not.

Starring with Hunnam (FX’s “Sons of Anarchy”) and Oscar nominee Law (“Cold Mountain,” “The Talented Mr. Ripley”) are Astrid Bergès-Frisbey (“Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides”) as Mage; Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou (“Blood Diamond,” “In America”) as Bedivere; Aidan Gillen (HBO’s “Game of Thrones”) as Goosefat Bill; and Eric Bana (“Star Trek”) as Arthur’s father, King Uther Pendragon.

Guy Ritchie (“The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,” the “Sherlock Holmes” films) directed the film from a screenplay is by Joby Harold (“Awake”) and Guy Ritchie & Lionel Wigram, story by David Dobkin (“The Judge”) and Joby Harold. The film is produced by Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman (“A Beautiful Mind,” “I Am Legend”), Joby Harold, Tory Tunnell (“Awake,” “Holy Rollers”), and “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.” and “Sherlock Holmes” producers Steve Clark-Hall, Guy Ritchie and Lionel Wigram. David Dobkin and Bruce Berman are executive producers.

Ritchie’s behind-the-scenes creative team included two-time Oscar-nominated director of photography John Mathieson (“Gladiator,” “The Phantom of the Opera”), Oscar-nominated production designer Gemma Jackson (“Finding Neverland”), editor James Herbert (“The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,” “Edge of Tomorrow”), costume designer Annie Symons (Masterpiece Theater’s “Great Expectations”), makeup and hair designer Christine Blundell (“Mr. Turner,” the “Sherlock Holmes” films), and Oscar-nominated VFX Supervisor Nick Davis (“The Dark Knight”). The music is by Daniel Pemberton (“The Man from U.N.C.L.E.”).

Warner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Weed Road/Safehouse Pictures Production, a Ritchie/Wigram Production, a Guy Ritchie film, “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.” Slated for release on March 24, 2017, the film will be distributed in North America by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.

Acclaimed filmmaker Guy Ritchie brings his dynamic style to the epic fantasy action adventure “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.” Starring Charlie Hunnam in the title role, the film is an iconoclastic take on the classic Excalibur myth, tracing Arthur’s journey from the streets to the throne.

When the child Arthur’s father is murdered, Vortigern (Jude Law), Arthur’s uncle, seizes the crown. Robbed of his birthright and with no idea who he truly is, Arthur comes up the hard way in the back alleys of the city. But once he pulls the sword from the stone, his life is turned upside down and he is forced to acknowledge his true legacy…whether he likes it or not.

Starring with Hunnam (FX’s “Sons of Anarchy”) and Oscar nominee Law (“Cold Mountain,” “The Talented Mr. Ripley”) are Astrid Bergès-Frisbey (“Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides”) as Mage; Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou (“Blood Diamond,” “In America”) as Bedivere; Aidan Gillen (HBO’s “Game of Thrones”) as Goosefat Bill; and Eric Bana (“Star Trek”) as Arthur’s father, King Uther Pendragon.

Guy Ritchie (“The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,” the “Sherlock Holmes” films) directed the film from a screenplay is by Joby Harold (“Awake”) and Guy Ritchie & Lionel Wigram, story by David Dobkin (“The Judge”) and Joby Harold. The film is produced by Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman (“A Beautiful Mind,” “I Am Legend”), Joby Harold, Tory Tunnell (“Awake,” “Holy Rollers”), and “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.” and “Sherlock Holmes” producers Steve Clark-Hall, Guy Ritchie and Lionel Wigram. David Dobkin and Bruce Berman are executive producers.

Ritchie’s behind-the-scenes creative team included two-time Oscar-nominated director of photography John Mathieson (“Gladiator,” “The Phantom of the Opera”), Oscar-nominated production designer Gemma Jackson (“Finding Neverland”), editor James Herbert (“The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,” “Edge of Tomorrow”), costume designer Annie Symons (Masterpiece Theater’s “Great Expectations”), makeup and hair designer Christine Blundell (“Mr. Turner,” the “Sherlock Holmes” films), and Oscar-nominated VFX Supervisor Nick Davis (“The Dark Knight”). The music is by Daniel Pemberton (“The Man from U.N.C.L.E.”).

Warner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Weed Road/Safehouse Pictures Production, a Ritchie/Wigram Production, a Guy Ritchie film, “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.” Slated for release on March 24, 2017, the film will be distributed in North America by Warner Bros.

Synopsis: The beautiful Belle ignores her suitor, the vain Gaston, as she cares for her father, the eccentric Maurice. When Maurice stumbles upon a foreboding castle while lost in the woods, the servants, enchanted into household objects, try to make him welcome, but he is thrown into the dungeon by the Beast. Belle comes to rescue her father and agrees to remain in the castle as his substitute. In order to break the spell, Beast must learn to love another and to be loved in return. Belle seems a likely candidate, but it takes Beast a while to reign in his temper. Belle desperately misses her father, so Beast sadly allows her to leave. Gaston, realizing Beast is a rival for Belle’s affection, leads the townsfolk to storm the castle. Belle rushes back in time to profess her love for Beast, and the spell is broken.

Trivia:
• The film’s end credits version of “Beauty and the Beast” was performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson. 
• Since lyricist Howard Ashman had died earlier in the year, the film was dedicated to him: “To our friend, Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful.” 
• Production of the film took 3½ years and required the talents of nearly 600 animators, artists, and technicians. 
• Portions of the film were animated at Disney’s satellite facility at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida. 
• Art directors working on the film travelled to the Loire valley in France for inspiration, and studied the great French romantic painters such as Fragonard and Boucher. 
• Glen Keane, the supervising animator on Beast, created his own hybrid beast by combining the mane of a lion, the beard and head structure of a buffalo, the tusks and nose bridge of a wild boar, the heavily muscled brow of a gorilla, the legs and tail of a wolf, and the big and bulky body of a bear. 
• Computer-generated imagery was used in several parts of the film, most notably in the “Be Our Guest” sequence and in the creation of a striking three-dimensional ballroom background, allowing dramatic camera moves on the animated characters as they danced. 
• Academy Award nominee in seven categories, including, for the first time for an animated feature, that of Best Picture, it won for Best Song (“Beauty and the Beast”) and Best Original Score.",2014-05-27T12:47:58Z,"['Disney', 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Belle', 'Beast', 'Gaston', 'Lumiere', 'Cogsworth', 'Mrs. Potts', 'Chip', ""Paige O'Hara"", 'Robby Benson', 'Richard White', 'Jerry Orbach', 'David Ogden Stiers', 'Angela Lansbury', 'Gary Trousdale', 'Kirk Wise', 'Alan Menken', 'Howard Ashman', 'Be Our Guest']",52492,0,0,0,321612,0.341643897996357

Z9AYPxH5NTM,Call Me By Your Name | Official Trailer HD (2017),Sony Pictures Classics,UCruD_lL-5fmllpKMSL-yCyQ,"CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, the new film by Luca Guadagnino, is a sensual and transcendent tale of first love, based on the acclaimed novel by André Aciman.

It’s the summer of 1983 in the north of Italy, and Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), a precocious 17- year-old American-Italian boy, spends his days in his family’s 17th century villa transcribing and playing classical music, reading, and flirting with his friend Marzia (Esther Garrel).
Elio enjoys a close relationship with his father (Michael Stuhlbarg), an eminent professor specializing in Greco-Roman culture, and his mother Annella (Amira Casar), a translator, who favor him with the fruits of high culture in a setting that overflows with natural delights. While Elio’s sophistication and intellectual gifts suggest he is already a fully-fledged adult, there is much that yet remains innocent and unformed about him, particularly about matters of the heart.
One day, Oliver (Armie Hammer), a charming American scholar working on his doctorate, arrives as the annual summer intern tasked with helping Elio’s father. Amid the sun-drenched
splendor of the setting, Elio and Oliver discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.

Hugo Gélin’s bona fide crowd-pleaser not only stormed France’s Christmas holiday season (achieving a phenomenal 3 million + admissions), it also charmed audiences internationally, becoming the most popular French-language film of 2017 worldwide.
Samuel (the irrepressible Omar Sy, The Intouchables) enjoys an A-list, hedonistic lifestyle on the sun-drenched beaches of the Côte d’Azur. Life is good, until the day former lover Kristin (Clémence Poésy) arrives out of nowhere and deposits the fruits of their tryst – an infant daughter, Gloria – in his care.

Incapable of looking after a baby, Samuel rushes to the UK in an attempt to return the child to her mother, without any luck. He decides to stay in London and, after finding work as a television stuntman, their relationship slowly begins to bloom. When Kristin eventually reappears, Gloria has grown into a bright and effervescent eight year old… and the inseparable father-daughter team finds their connections tested.

Filled with colour, humour, emotion and great performances, TWO IS A FAMILY is a lavishly-produced slice of entertainment that also touches on themes of class, social responsibility and the challenges of parenthood. Few films are as well-crafted to leave audiences with a smile (and perhaps a few tears too).",2018-05-03T10:28:20Z,[],122073,542,13,0,382591,0.3158756137479542

Samuel lives his life without any attachments or responsibilities, beside the sea in the sunshine of southern France, near to people he loves and with whom he works without tiring himself too much.
 That is until the day that one of his former girlfriends deposits a little baby in his arms: Gloria, his daughter! Incapable of looking after a baby and determined to give the baby back to her mother, Samuel dashes to London in an attempt to find her, without any luck.
 Eight years later, Samuel and Gloria have made their life in Paris and are now inseparable. Then Gloria's mother turns up and wants her daughter back...

From Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures comes the romantic drama “Everything, Everything,” directed by Stella Meghie and based on the bestselling book of the same name by Nicola Yoon.

What if you couldn’t touch anything in the outside world? Never breathe in the fresh air, feel the sun warm your face…or kiss the boy next door? “Everything, Everything” tells the unlikely love story of Maddy, a smart, curious and imaginative 18-year-old who due to an illness cannot leave the protection of the hermetically sealed environment within her house, and Olly, the boy next door who won’t let that stop them.

Maddy is desperate to experience the much more stimulating outside world, and the promise of her first romance. Gazing through windows and talking only through texts, she and Olly form a deep bond that leads them to risk everything to be together…even if it means losing everything.

“Everything, Everything” stars Amandla Stenberg (“The Hunger Games”) as Maddy and Nick Robinson (“Jurassic World”) as Olly. The film also stars Ana de la Reguera (“Sun Belt Express”) and Anika Noni Rose (“Dreamgirls”).

Meghie (“Jean of the Joneses”) directs from the screenplay written by J. Mills Goodloe (“The Age of Adaline”). Leslie Morgenstein and Elysa Dutton are producing under the Alloy Entertainment banner, with Victor Ho executive producing.

The behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Igor Jadue-Lillo (“The Kids Are All Right”); production designer Charisse Cardenas (“American Sniper”); editor Nancy Richardson (“Insurgent,” “Divergent”); and costume designer Avery Plewes (“Jean of the Joneses”).

An Alloy Entertainment production, “Everything, Everything” is set for release on May 19, 2017. It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select international territories by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures.",2017-04-26T18:00:04Z,"['everything', 'everything everything', 'nicola yoon', 'stella meghie', 'maddy', 'olly', 'amandla stenberg', 'nick robinson', 'ana de la reguera', 'anika noni rose', 'alloy', 'movie', 'romantic comedy', 'romcom', 'warner bros', 'warner bros pictures', 'wb', 'warner brothers', 'mgm', 'emoji', 'emojis', 'emoji trailer']",779775,1862,1849,0,417678,0.33525641025641023

On the heels of 2015’s Furious 7, one of the fastest movies to reach $1 billion worldwide in box-office history and the sixth-biggest global title of all time, comes the newest chapter in one of the most popular and enduring motion-picture serials of all time: The Fate of the Furious.  

Now that Dom and Letty are on their honeymoon and Brian and Mia have retired from the game—and the rest of the crew has been exonerated—the globetrotting team has found a semblance of a normal life.  But when a mysterious woman (Oscar® winner Charlize Theron) seduces Dom into the world of crime he can’t seem to escape and a betrayal of those closest to him, they will face trials that will test them as never before.   

From the shores of Cuba and the streets of New York City to the icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea, our elite force will crisscross the globe to stop an anarchist from unleashing chaos on the world’s stage…and to bring home the man who made them a family.

For The Fate of the Furious, Vin Diesel is joined by a returning all-star cast that includes Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Elsa Pataky and Kurt Russell.  In addition to Theron, the series welcomes newcomers Scott Eastwood and Oscar® winner Helen Mirren.  The film is directed by F.

Synopsis: 
Rooted in the classic graphic novel series, Valerian and Laureline- visionary writer/director Luc Besson advances this iconic source material into a contemporary, unique and epic science fiction saga.
 
Valerian (Dane DeHaan) and Laureline (Cara Delevingne) are special operatives for the government of the human territories charged with maintaining order throughout the universe. 

Under directive from their Commander (Clive Owen), Valerian and Laureline embark on a mission to the breathtaking intergalactic city of Alpha, an ever-expanding metropolis comprised of thousands of different species from all four corners of the universe. Alpha’s seventeen million inhabitants have converged over time- uniting their talents, technology and resources for the betterment of all. Unfortunately, not everyone on Alpha shares in these same objectives; in fact, unseen forces are at work, placing our race in great danger.

In a not so distant future, where overpopulation and famine have forced governments to undertake a drastic One-Child Policy, seven identical sisters (all of them portrayed by Noomi Rapace) live a hide-and-seek existence pursued by the Child Allocation Bureau. The Bureau, directed by the fierce Nicolette Cayman (Glenn Close), enforces a strict family-planning agenda that the sisters outwit by taking turns assuming the identity of one person: Karen Settman. Taught by their grandfather (Willem Dafoe) who raised and named them - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday - each can go outside once a week as their common identity, but are only free to be themselves in the prison of their own apartment. That is until, one day, Monday does not come home.

In einer nahen Zukunft haben Überbevölkerung und Hungersnot zu einer drastischen Ein-Kind-Politik geführt. Dadurch sind sieben identisch aussehende Schwestern (Noomi Rapace) zu einem Versteckspiel gezwungen, um der Verfolgung durch das „Child Allocation Bureau“ unter Leitung der unerbittlichen Nicolette Cayman (Glenn Close) zu entkommen. Um zu überleben, müssen Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday und Sunday, wie die Frauen von ihrem Großvater (Willem Dafoe) genannt wurden, die Identität einer fiktiven Person annehmen - Karen Settman. Einmal pro Woche darf jede der Schwestern am Wochentag, dessen Namen sie trägt, an die Öffentlichkeit und am Leben teilnehmen, während die restlichen sechs in der gemeinsamen Wohnung gefangen sind. Das geht so lange gut, bis Monday eines Tages nicht mehr nach Hause zurückkehrt.

The Last Knight shatters the core myths of the Transformers franchise, and redefines what it means to be a hero.  Humans and Transformers are at war, Optimus Prime is gone.  The key to saving our future lies buried in the secrets of the past, in the hidden history of Transformers on Earth.  Saving our world falls upon the shoulders of an unlikely alliance: Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg); Bumblebee; an English Lord (Sir Anthony Hopkins); and an Oxford Professor (Laura Haddock).

There comes a moment in everyone’s life when we are called upon to make a difference.  In Transformers: The Last Knight, the hunted will become heroes.  Heroes will become villains.  Only one world will survive: theirs, or ours.

Transformers is coming to theatres June 2017!

Watch the new international trailer for #Transformers: The Last Knight, and get tickets now: tickets.transformersmovie.com

The Last Knight shatters the core myths of the Transformers franchise, and redefines what it means to be a hero.  Humans and Transformers are at war, Optimus Prime is gone.  The key to saving our future lies buried in the secrets of the past, in the hidden history of Transformers on Earth.  Saving our world falls upon the shoulders of an unlikely alliance: Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg); Bumblebee; an English Lord (Sir Anthony Hopkins); and an Oxford Professor (Laura Haddock).

There comes a moment in everyone’s life when we are called upon to make a difference.  In Transformers: The Last Knight, the hunted will become heroes.  Heroes will become villains.  Only one world will survive: theirs, or ours.

Transformers is coming to theatres June 2017!
Directed by Michael Bay
Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Josh Duhamel, Anthony Hopkins, Laura Haddock, Isabella Moner, Stanley Tucci, John Turturro

Die Brüder Jimmy und Clyde Logan werden vom Pech verfolgt. Während der impulsive Jimmy (Channing Tatum) einen Job nach dem nächsten verliert, wird Barkeeper Clyde (Adam Driver), der nur einen Arm hat, regelmäßig schikaniert. Und dann wären da noch die Geldsorgen. Aber Jimmy hat eine brillante Idee, die den beiden aus der misslichen Lage helfen soll: Ein Raubüberfall im großen Stil! Das prestigeträchtigste und legendärste NASCAR-Rennen der Welt, der Coca-Cola Cup 600, bietet scheinbar die perfekten Voraussetzungen für einen cleveren, unterirdischen Raubzug! Unterstützung erhoffen sich die Brüder vom berüchtigtsten platinblonden Safeknacker des Landes: Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) – der sitzt allerdings noch im Gefängnis fest. Während der Planung des großen Coups tauchen immer neue Hindernisse auf, doch gemeinsam mit ihrer Schwester Mellie (Riley Keough) setzen die beiden Brüder alles daran, ihre lebenslange Pechstränge endlich zu beenden.
