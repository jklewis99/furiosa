clip.py:
    FuriosaVideoClip:
        initialization: Complete; 2-3 seconds

        trim: Complete, but requires external validation of parameters
            - with subclip method 1-2 seconds, 
            + with set_start/set_end 0-0.0001 seconds
            After further testing, however, set_start and set_end do not
            actually mutate the clip, only attributes on that clip
            the set_end method works, but the set_start does not. For 
            speed purposes, it may be needed to work with these methods,
            but for now, I will need to use subclip

        split: Complete; 0.5-0.6 seconds
